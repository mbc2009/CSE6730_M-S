The parametrization has been based on a fit of the temperature of maximum density (indirectly estimated from the melting point of hexagonal ice), the stability of several ice polymorphs and other commonly used target quantities. The calculated properties include a variety of thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid phases, the phase diagram involving condensed phases, properties at melting and vaporization, dielectric constant, pair distribution function, and self-diffusion coefficient. These properties cover a temperature range from 123to573K and pressures up to 40000bar. The model gives an impressive performance for this variety of properties and thermodynamic conditions.

  abstract = {In recent years, the gap between Deep Learning (DL) methods and analytical or numerical approaches in scientific computing is tried to be filled by the evolution of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, still, there are many complications in the training of PINNs and optimal interleaving of physical models. Here, we introduced the concept of Physical Activation Functions (PAFs). This concept offers that instead of using general activation functions (AFs) such as ReLU, tanh, and sigmoid for all the neurons, one can use generic AFs that their mathematical expression is inherited from the physical laws of the investigating phenomena. The formula of PAFs may be inspired by the terms in the analytical solution of the problem. We showed that the PAFs can be inspired by any mathematical formula related to the investigating phenomena such as the initial or boundary conditions of the PDE system. We validated the advantages of PAFs for several PDEs including the harmonic oscillations, Burgers, Advection-Convection equation, and the heterogeneous diffusion equations. The main advantage of PAFs was in the more efficient constraining and interleaving of PINNs with the investigating physical phenomena and their underlying mathematical models. This added constraint significantly improved the predictions of PINNs for the testing data that was out-of-training distribution. Furthermore, the application of PAFs reduced the size of the PINNs up to 75\% in different cases. Also, the value of loss terms was reduced by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in some cases which is noteworthy for upgrading the training of the PINNs. The iterations required for finding the optimum values were also significantly reduced. It is concluded that using the PAFs helps in generating PINNs with less complexity and much more validity for longer ranges of prediction.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is an emerging thermal-based membrane technology that has the capacity to treat a wide range of feed waters, including high salinity brines and wastewater. Compared with pressure-driven processes, MD has the following advantages: low electrical energy consumption, complete removal of non-volatile solutes and ambient operating pressures. On the other hand, membrane fouling and pore wetting remain a challenge holding back its wider industrial implementation. To manage this issue, effective pretreatment and cleaning strategies are essential, as with other membrane processes. Despite the importance of these aspects for achieving a stable and reliable water treatment process, far too little attention has been paid to them in the MD literature. Evidence of this is that a comprehensive review on both membrane cleaning and pretreatment in MD is still lacking, despite the large and growing number of publications related to the technology. In this work, we first provide an overview of the three main types of fouling present in MD: inorganic, organic and biological fouling. After this we review, in detail, the use of pretreatment protocols in a range of MD applications, highlighting their efficacy in preventing fouling and ensuring stable performance. Next, we review the use of state-ofthe-art chemical and physical cleaning strategies and discuss the development of 'self-cleaning' membranes that are superhydrophobic or omniphobic. Finally, future research directions are suggested, with the aim of helping researchers working in this field to develop membrane distillation technology towards wider commercial implementation.},

  abstract = {Maxwell published about a hundred scientific papers. While his main claim to fame lies in his work on electromagnetism and the kinetic theory of gases, he was interested in almost all branches of physics, both mathematical and experimental, and especially in mechanics, geometry, and optics. Maxwell's researches on electromagnetism were aimed at constructing, at a theoretical level, a unified mathematical theory of electric and magnetic phenomena that would express the methods and ideas of Faraday as an alternative to the theory of Weber. Maxwell presented a combination of two general field equations and implied a new representation of the magnetic effects of closed circuits, according to which the current of conduction in a conducting wire is extended by a current of displacement in the dielectric to form a closed ``total current.'' He then obtained a wave equation from certain field equations from which he again deduced a speed of propagation equal to {$\nu$}. He concluded not only that ``light and magnetism are affections of the same substance'' but also that ``light is an electromagnetic disturbance propagated through the field according to the electromagnetic laws.'' Thus, Maxwell introduced the notion of electricity as a measurable physical quantity, independent of the hypothesis of electric fluids. He stated Coulomb's law in the same way and defined the key entities of electrostatics. These experiments, soon repeated by many physicists, assured the triumph of Maxwell's theory and its adherents in Britain. They also had the effect of drawing attention to the work of Heaviside.},

  abstract = {In this study, a comprehensive model was developed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and the behaviour of a direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) system was investigated at hypersaline feedwater conditions. The effects of various operating parameters including feed and permeate velocities, temperatures and salinities, as well as different membrane characteristics like thickness, porosity, and thermal conductivity were studied. The developed simulation model was also validated using experimental data. The results showed that the membrane conductivity and thickness had a significant impact on the DCMD performance, and the optimum operational condition was necessary to be determined. The results showed that increasing the feedwater salinity from 50 to 200~g/l decreased the membrane flux by up to 33\%, while a four times decrease in thermal conductivity of the membrane could lead to an increase in the membrane flux from 11.2 to 32.4~l/m2{$\cdot$}h (LMH). In addition, the optimal membrane thickness was found to increase with salinity, reaching {$>$}120~{$\mu$}m for treatment of 22~wt\% NaCl feedwater solution. However, the flux declined from {$>$}32 LMH to {$<$}13 LMH upon the increase in feedwater salinity (up to 22~wt\% NaCl solution). It is also shown that a thinner membrane performed better for desalination of low salinity feedwater, while the thicker one produces higher separation performance and thermal efficiency for hypersaline brine desalination.},

This review provides an overview of the various conventional and non-conventional heating methods used in the MD process, focusing on its application for water desalination. To make MD competitive with existing technologies, research should be directed at low-cost energy sources or alternative heating methods. Development of alternative heating methods is based on the direct heating of feed water where the driving force for distillation can be generated inside the membrane module, as is the case for photothermal heating, electrothermal heating or induction heating. Direct heating of the feed near the membrane surface can improve the thermal efficiency and economics of the MD process. Through this literature survey, we have identified some areas to guide future research in alternative heating techniques for membrane distillation.},

In an attempt to lower carbon footprint resulting from high-energy consuming desalination processes, attention has shifted to using renewable energy sources to power desalination. With solar irradiation ample in regions that heavily rely on desalination, solar powered desalination provides a sustainable solution to meeting water needs. The compatibility of each desalination process with the solar technology is driven by whether the kind of energy needed is thermal or electrical, as well as its availability. With rapid advances in solar energy technologies both photovoltaic and solar thermal, there has also been growing interest in coupling solar energy with desalination, with a focus on improving energy efficiency.

In the initial state, with no voltage applied, these surfaces exhibit contact angles as high as 150 degrees for a wide variety of liquids with surface tensions ranging from 21.8 mN/m (ethanol) to 72.0 mN/m (water). Upon application of an electrical voltage, a transition from the superlyophobic state to wetting is observed. We have examined experimentally and theoretically the nature of these transitions.

  abstract = {Membrane fouling is a major problem in brackish and seawater desalination as well as in membrane mediated waste water reclamation. Fouling of nanofiltration (NF) membranes is typically caused by inorganic and organic materials present in water that adhere to the surface and pores of the membrane and results in deterioration of performance (reduced membrane flux) with a consequent increase in costs of energy and early membrane replacement. Natural organic matter (NOM) fouling of NF membranes involves interrelationship between physical and chemical interactions and it is described in this review. Membrane fouling in the presence of NOM can be influenced by: membrane characteristics, including surface structure as well as surface chemical properties, chemistry of feed solution including ionic strength, pH and concentration of monovalent ions and divalent ions, NOM properties, including molecular weight and polarity, and hydrodynamic and operating conditions including permeate flux, pressure, concentration polarization, and the mass transfer properties of the fluid boundary layer. These factors will be discussed in details in this review. Inorganic fouling due to scale formation of sparingly soluble inorganic salts occurs whenever the ionic salt concentration stream exceeds the equilibrium solubility. Scale formation take place by homogenous or heterogeneous crystallization and its factors will be also investigated in this review.},

  abstract = {The two main methods of removing salt from ocean water currently in use for large scale applications are: distillation using thermal desalination and membrane reverse osmosis separation. A detailed knowledge of the CO2 solubility in the seawater at the conditions prevailing in the system is required for the modeling of CO2 release in the multi-stage flash distillers. The measurement of the solubility of CO2 in pure water has been extensively studied in the literature, whereas there is a lack of saline solutions studies. Several studies have investigated the solubility of CO2 in seawater under different temperatures and pressures without covering the conditions that prevailed in the desalination plants for example low pressures and high temperatures. The gas solubility can be theoretically estimated by considering the ionic strength and the salting-out parameter in the low-pressure regime, i.e., near atmospheric pressure. The measurements of gas solubility can be made as a function of the seawater temperature and salinity at low pressure where effect of pressure can be considered negligible. Alkaline scale formation causes fouling in the MSF plants and it is known that the rate of formation of calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide in seawater depends on a number of parameters such as temperature, pH, concentration of bicarbonate ions, rate of CO2 release, concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, and total dissolved solids. This review shows an overview of the carbon dioxide solubility in the high concentrated saline water, carbonate equilibriums in the seawater and the various correlations used to characterize the CO2-seawater system.},

  abstract = {In this work, an extensive analysis on direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) performance was developed to estimate the mass flux and the heat efficiency, considering transport phenomena, membrane structural properties and most sensitive process parameters, with the aim to provide optimization guidelines for materials and methods. The results showed that an increase of the temperature gradient resulted in the enhancement of both transmembrane flux and thermal efficiency. The investigation of the effects of membrane properties confirmed that better DCMD performance was achieved when using polymeric membranes characterized by low thermal conductivity (flux and thermal efficiency declined by 26\% and 50\%, respectively, when increasing thermal conductivity from 0.1 to 0.5W/mK), and high porosity. An optimal thickness value (around 0.7mm) was identified when operating at low temperature gradient ({$<$}5{$^\circ$}C). However, at higher temperature gradient ({$>$}10{$^\circ$}C), increasing the membrane thickness from 0.25 to 1.55mm resulted in a flux decay of about 70\% without a significant improvement in thermal efficiency. Exergy analysis, sensitivity study and economical evaluation were carried out to assess the feasibility of DCMD process. For DCMD with heat recovery, the estimated water cost was \$1.17m-3, which was comparable to the cost of water produced by conventional thermal processes: i.e. around \$1.00m-3 for multiple effect distillation (MED) and \$1.40m-3 for multi-stage flash (MSF). However, significant savings are expected when using a low-grade thermal energy source, decreasing the cost of DCMD to values approaching the cost of water produced by reverse osmosis (RO), which is about \$0.50m-3.},

This article reports on the mechanisms and effects associated with magnetic treatment.           ,                             Scaling is the bane of households and industries that make use of water frequently. The consequences are so egregious that harmful chemicals have been sought after to remedy the situation. These chemicals, though efficacious, do more harm than good because they render water unsuitable for human consumption and cause ecological imbalance. Anti-scale magnetic water devices offer a               cleaner               solution to handling the scaling dilemma. This method of water treatment has been in existence for more than a century and is still the subject of much debate today, with the method being viewed with much skepticism, although evidence of its efficacy has been provided on countless occasions. Reports are given on several effects associated with magnetic water treatment, as well as proposed mechanisms. Yet no general consensus has been reached regarding the treatment method's mode of operation, which could explain the cynical reception magnetic water devices often receive. Insights into the enigmatic technique of magnetic water treatment attempt to explain magnetic effects on water and its constituents, citing explanations, which are unrelated to the current principles of magnetism. Several reports and accounts that involve the use and application of anti-scale magnetic water treatment are elucidated with special focus on calcium carbonate scale and its transformation.},

Air gap MD (AGMD) configuration was considered, using a 35~g~L-1 NaCl solution with 150~mg~L-1 (150~ppm) of Triton X-100 surfactant as feed material. The GO is deposited as a laminate membrane on top of a commercial porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) support and good adhesion is achieved through the use of polydopamine (PDA) to form a hydrophilic tri-layer membrane. The small pore size achieved with the laminate GO led to increased pore wetting resistance for at least 90~h compared to 20~min with pristine commercial PVDF. Additionally, the extra layers of GO and PDA did not affect the membrane flux. Overall, a tri-layer immobilized GO membrane is synthesized with superior performance when compared to current commercial membranes, meaning that MD can be used for a new range of wastewater applications.},

  abstract = {Forward osmosis (FO) is one of the emerging membrane technologies which has gained interest in the last decade for being a low energy desalination process. The most important factors controlling FO processes are performance, recyclability and cost of the draw solution (DS) used together with the FO membrane itself because they play a crucial role on the feasibility of this technology. Consequently, the selection of an appropriate DS is vital for the process efficiency, besides the required selectivity and permeance of the membrane and the efficient DS regeneration process. A wide variety of DS have been tested so far and this paper aims to review recent advances in the synthesis and selection of an appropriate DS. It provides valuable information on a new type of draw solutes based on hybrid organic-inorganic nanosystems which, at a certain extent, show synergistic properties that face some of the technology shortcomings. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are the most promising nanosystems intended for desalination because they can be readily recovered applying a magnetic field or by conventional membrane processes. This review also deals with the most important characteristics of DS based on nanoparticles (NPs) and how they affect the performance of the overall processes. Finally, this review also highlights future research directions, where nanosystems will mitigate inverse diffusion and concentration polarization phenomena widely reported as limiting factors in FO processes.

  abstract = {Growing requirements of freshwater and unsustainable nature of fossil fuels are driving the interest in using renewable energy for desalination applications. Due to their less energy-intensive nature and small footprint, membrane-based desalination operations are gaining significant interest in this regard. Substantial efforts have been observed in integrating traditional renewable and relatively green sources of energy (wind, solar, geothermal, tidal and nuclear) with membrane-based desalination operations, mainly reverse osmosis (RO) and electrodialysis (ED). Due to recent developments and progresses in membrane technology, interesting membrane operations including membrane distillation (MD), pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) and reverse electrodialysis (RED) have emerged. These operations are capable of generating clean and sustainable electricity from various waste streams including brine and impaired water which otherwise are considered environmental liabilities. PRO and RED require mixing of a high salinity solution (such as seawater or brine and wastewater, respectively) with a low salinity solution to generate electricity. MD has shown the potential to generate freshwater and electricity as standalone process. Integration of MD with PRO or RED enhances the performance of these processes and provides a clean and sustainable route to produce freshwater and energy. The current study reviews the recent progresses and developments in applying renewable energy sources in membrane-based desalination with special attention on emerging membrane operations with proven capability to generate energy from wastewater streams.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is a promising emerging water desalination technology. Commercialization of MD modules has been hindered by ineffective heat recovery and temperature polarization effect. Although hollow fiber (HF) membranes provide the highest area-per-module, they are under-investigated compared to flat-sheet membranes due to the interconnection of geometric, thermal, and hydrodynamic parameters in HF MD process. In this work, the parameters impacting HF MD module design are performed based on multiscale and deep neural network (DNN) models. MD experiments are conducted to train and validate the machine learning and multiscale models. The developed models are used either to explain the effects of geometric, thermal, and hydrodynamic parameters on the permeate flux or to predict the flux of a given set of parameters. The results revealed an increase in flux with the flow rate, velocity, and feed temperature. However, it decreased with shell diameter and module length. Compared to the experimental fluxes, flux predictions using multiscale and DNN approaches were within 14\% and 1.2\%, respectively. The DNN model converged to a mean squared error of 1.21\% (R2 = 0.96) within a few minutes and demonstrated its potential as a favorable tool for module design optimization due to its accuracy, speed, and low computational requirements. The present study effectively exhibits the advantages of using machine learning as a next-generation model for fast module design, optimization, and scale-up of MD technology.},

In this paper, we implement a physics informed neural network (PINN) technique that incorporates information from the fluid flow physics as well as observed data to model the Buckley-Leverett problem. The classical problem of drainage of gas into a water-filled porous medium is used to validate our implementation. Several cases are tested that signify the importance of the coupling between observed data and physics-informed neural networks for different parameter space. Our results indicate that PINNs are capable of capturing the overall trend of the solution even without observed data but the resolution and accuracy of the solution are improved tremendously with observed data. Adding a small amount of diffusion to the PDE-constrained loss function improved the solution slightly only when observed data were used. Moreover, the PINN is used to solve the inverse problem and infer the most optimal multiphase flow parameters. The performance of the PINN is compared to that of an artificial neural network (ANN) without any physics. We show that the ANN performs comparably well to the PINN when the observed data used to train the ANN include times that span the early- and late-time behavior. As opposed to the PINN, the ANN is not able to predict the solution when only early-time saturation profiles are provided as observed data and extrapolation are needed.},

Farmer's group (1996) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), to the utilization of novel graphene and carbon nanotube (CNT) materials as electrodes, the CDI and MCDI technologies are progressively making its path to the desalination industry. Through this review various deficiencies of this technology have been identified, first and far most was the need for low cost and efficient electrode materials. The review identified that a low cost and high efficiency electrode capable of processing high salinity (seawater) stream still does not exists and is considered important if the technology is to make it to the industry. Furthermore, the lack of long term reliability, operation demonstrations and experience meant that information about scaling and fouling are rather scarce.

The studied technologies were ultrafiltration (EC-UF), reverse osmosis (EC-BO), forward osmosis (EC-FO), membrane distillation (EC-MD), forward osmosis-membrane distillation (EC-FO-MD), membrane bioreactor (EC-MBR), electrodialysis (EC-ED), ozonation (EC-O-3), ultraviolet (EC-UVC/VUV), peroxi-electrocoagulation (EC-H2O2), activated carbon adsorption (EC-AC), biofiltration (EC-BF) and electrooxidation (EC-EO). The overall performance was evaluated using pollutants removal efficiency, energy consumption and operational cost. Then, the performance of pilot scale hybrid electrocoagulation processes and the current status of implementation was discussed. The future potential of electrocoagulation lies with proper hybridization of EC with other water treatment processes that would minimize the overall cost and enhance quality of the treated water.},

The proposed CNN framework is trained with binary images and greyscale images separately and the corresponding computed properties. The results from testing the model are promising as the relative error in determination of porosity, surface area and average pore size is less than 6\% when the model is trained with binary images and less than 7\% when greyscale images are used.

Laminar and k-{$\omega$} SST turbulence models are used to conduct simulations in three-dimensional modules with and without spacers. The spacers are placed in the middle of the feed and permeate channel. The net type spacers of diameter 0.25h and 0.5h were considered, where h is the height of each channel. The inlet temperature of the feed and the permeate channel set to 353 K and 293 K. The feed Reynolds number is varied (500, 1500) while the permeate Reynolds number is fixed at 330. We revealed that the presence of spacer in the flow channels mitigates both the temperature and the concentration polarization and yields higher vapor permeation. We also showed that the module containing larger size spacers yields better flux performance and lower level of temperature and concentration polarization. Moreover, the modules containing spacers become more efficient as the feed flow rate is increased.},

The main purpose of the present study was to investigate whether or not a physical water treatment reduces the surface tension of water as reported in some scientific literature. In this paper PWT phenomenon was studied by measuring surface tension of treated and untreated waters. More than 200 tests were done during a six month period in various conditions to evaluate the validity of the observed phenomenon. The test results showed that surface tension of water is too sensitive to experimental conditions to be considered as a safe and reliable indicator for studying the effects of magnetic field on water. It was found that meaningful changes in surface tension of a liquid sample after a day can be a good indicator for presence of physical or chemical changes in the sample.},

The present study examines how the addition of cylindrical filaments in the feed channel increases momentum mixing and the overall performance of VMD modules under different operating inlet conditions. Three-dimensional transient Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are conducted using Wall-Adapting Local Eddy-Viscosity (WALE) subgrid-scale Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence model. Local concentration, temperature, and flux are coupled at the membrane surface to predict the rate of water vapor diffused through the membrane by Knudsen and viscous diffusion mechanisms. The predicted and measured vapor flux agrees reasonably well; validating the employed model. The small-scale eddies induced by the presence of spacer filaments promote mixing in the module, thus the temperature and concentration polarization is alleviated and the water vapor flux is immensely improved. The insertions of filaments in the feed channel increase the water permeate rate by more than 50\% at higher feed flow rates and inlet temperatures. The pressure drop by the spacer reduces the allowable module length by one order of magnitude, but the module length increases two folds at feed temperature 80 degrees C. Even though the power consumption of the module containing the filaments is increased, the addition of filaments is strongly recommended since the required power for the process could be supplied from readily available low-grade heat source.},

  abstract = {Air-gap membrane distillation (AGMD) is a novel method of water purification and promises to reduce heat requirements. However, AGMD is characterized by low water permeate flux and a significant downstream performance reduction including temperature, concentration polarisations and membrane fouling. These challenges are difficult to explore both experimentally and numerically. To date, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of AGMD focuses on temperature polarisation without considering solute transport. In addition, they lacked an accurate calculation of water flux affecting the distributed flow properties, especially close to the membrane. A 2D comprehensive study using CFD simulation of the AGMD was developed to determine the effectiveness of solar absorbers and spacer filaments on these challenges. A precise logarithmic function of vapour pressure was used to model the mass transfer within the membrane. The simulation was in excellent agreement with previously published experimental results. Results showed that using solar absorbers can slightly increase the water flux and decrease both the temperature and concentration polarisation effects. Additionally, the results were more sensitive to the air-gap thickness compared to using solar absorbers. Results also proved that cylindrical detached spacers provided higher water flux when compared to semicircular and rectangular attached spacers. The proposed spacer-filled module improved the AGMD performance and resulted in the uniform water flux from the inlet to the outlet. The water flux increased by 15~\%, and the downstream performance variation of the developed module was {$<$}3~\% throughout the module, compared to 21~\% for the module with no spacer. This is a very encouraging development for low-energy water purification systems.},

We assessed the influence of radio-frequency magnetic fields, used as a method of heating the membrane's surface, as part of a membrane distillation (RF-MD) process. The influence of RF heating on CaSO4 scaling is addressed in terms of distillate flux and crystal formation, and the results are compared to conventional MD systems. The RF-MD system included a thermally conducting dual-layer membrane containing a magnetic hydrophilic layer based on iron oxide-carbon nanotubes coated on a hydrophobic membrane. Heating the solution was mainly done directly at the membrane-water interface, and scaling was assessed at different feed flow velocities using feed solutions containing elevated concentrations of CaSO4 and NaCl and at ionic composition simulating RO brine. Results show only sporadic small CaSO4 crystals on the membrane surface following RF-MD, while high concentrations of small crystals were detected at the concentrate stream exiting the filtration module. Furthermore, the RF-MD system was able to produce enhanced distillate flux. The scaling mitigation mechanism is discussed in detail and hypothesized to be a result of the high-frequency movement and collision of the ions in the solution.},

  abstract = {The morphology of graphene is crucial for its applications, yet an adequate theory of its growth is lacking: It is either simplified to a phenomenological-continuum level or is overly detailed in atomistic simulations, which are often intractable. Here we put forward a comprehensive picture dubbed nanoreactor, which draws from ideas of step-flow crystal growth augmented by detailed first-principles calculations. As the carbon atoms migrate from the feedstock to catalyst to final graphene lattice, they go through a sequence of states whose energy levels can be computed and arranged into a step-by-step map. Analysis begins with the structure and energies of arbitrary edges to yield equilibrium island shapes. Then, it elucidates how the atoms dock at the edges and how they avoid forming defects. The sequence of atomic row assembly determines the kinetic anisotropy of growth, and consequently, graphene island morphology, explaining a number of experimental facts and suggesting how the growth product can further be improved. Finally, this analysis adds a useful perspective on the synthesis of carbon nanotubes and its essential distinction from graphene.},

Physical principles determine the stability of proteins and nucleic acids, the rate at which biochemical reactions proceed, the transport of molecules across biological molecules; they allow us to describe structure and reactivity in complex biological systems, and make sense of how these systems operate. Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences provides a balanced presentation of the concepts of physical chemistry, and their extensive applications to biology and biochemistry. It is written to straddle the worlds of physical chemistry and the life sciences and to show students how the tools of physical chemistry can elucidate and illuminate biological questions. Opening with a suite of chapters on Biochemical Thermodynamics, with a focus on energy conversion in biological cells and the factors that stabilize proteins, nucleic acids, and cell membranes, the book goes on to explore the Kinetics of Life Processes, examining the rates of chemical reactions, how rates can help characterise the mechanism of a reaction, and how enzymes affect reaction rates. A third section, Biomolecular Structure, looks at how concepts of physical chemistry can be used to establish those 'rules' that govern the assembly of complex biological structures, while the final section, Biomolecular Spectroscopy, describes the major techniques in biochemistry that are being applied to help us to explore biochemical processes and systems ever further. Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences places emphasis on clear explanations of difficult concepts, with an eye toward building insight into biochemical phenomena. An extensive range of learning features, including worked examples, illustrations, self-tests, and case studies, support student learning throughout, while special attention is given to providing extensive help to students with those mathematical concepts and techniques that are so central to a sound understanding of physical chemistry. Balancing clarity and rigor of exposition of basic concepts with extensive discussion of biological techniques and processes, Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences is the perfect resource for every life science student who seeks to master those essentials of physical chemistry that underpin life itself. Online Resource Centre For students: - Web links for each chapter, pointing students to interesting sources of related information and data, to facilitate self-directed learning - A list of key equations for each chapter, to help students revise and master the key mathematical concepts that underpin the subject - Living graphs, which present graphs from the text in interactive format, and enable students to strengthen their learning by manipulating key variables and exploring the consequeneces - Three-dimensional, interactive models of the biomolecules appearing in the end-of-book atlas of structures For registered adopters of the book: Figures in electronic format},

  abstract = {Calcium chloride and snail physiological salt solutions were exposed to static magnetic fields (2.3--350 mT), and the physical properties of the solutions as well as their biologic effects were studied. Our preliminary observations show that these fields alter physicochemical properties of CaCl2 solutions and the functional effects of physiological solutions. Experiments on CaCl2 solutions demonstrated field-dependent changes of electrical conductivity, with the magnitude and the direction of conductivity change being a function of both concentration and field intensity. The changes in conductivity were maintained for periods in excess of 1 h after exposure. Conductivity changes were not found after exposure of physiological solutions to static magnetic fields, but changes of biological consequence did occur. Other experiments showed that there were several changes in cellular function observed in ganglia and isolated neurons of Helix pomatia when the perfusing medium was changed from the normal physiologic solution to the same solution after exposure to magnetic fields. These changes include membrane depolarization and increased action potential discharge, reduced uptake of Ca into cells, altered content of cyclic nucleotides in ganglia, and increased volume of isolated cell bodies. A change in hydration of calcium ions may be one of the consequences of magnetic-field exposure, and in physiological solutions this change may have functional consequences. {\copyright} 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

  abstract = {The chemistry of several calcium sulphate systems was successfully modelled in multi-component acid-containing sulphate solutions using the mixed solvent electrolyte (MSE) model for calculating the mean activity coefficients of the electrolyte species. The modelling involved the fitting of binary mean activity, heat capacity and solubility data, as well as ternary solubility data. The developed model was shown to accurately predict the solubility of calcium sulphate from 25 to 95 degrees C in simulated zinc sulphate processing solutions containing MgSO4, MnSO4, Fe-2(SO4)(3), Na2SO4, (NH4)(2)SO4 and H2SO4. The addition of H2SO4 results in a significant increase in the calcium sulphate solubility compared to that in water. By increasing the acid concentration, gypsum, which is a metastable phase above 40 degrees C, dehydrates to anhydrite, and the conversion results in a decrease in the solubility of calcium sulphate. In ZnSO4-H2SO4 solutions, it was found that increasing MgSO4, Na2SO4, Fe-2(SO4)(3) and (NH4)(2)SO4 concentrations do not have a pronounced effect on the solubility of calcium sulphate. From a practical perspective, the model is valuable tool for assessing calcium sulphate solubilities over abroad temperature range and for dilute to concentrated multi-component solutions.

  abstract = {Understandable controversy surrounds the use of antiscale magnetic treatment (AMT) though considerable published evidence suggests it can often be effective. Common factors in reported successful applications include continuous recirculation of a hot (and often supersaturated) process feed water usually including a high ionic and suspended load. Much less success has been claimed at preventing scaling in once through, cooler systems or in membrane desalination. AMT for prevention of RO scaling could represent an ideal solution, specifically in those cases where the membrane is liable to foul predominantly with crystalline material. If it could be proven to be both effective and reliable, the need for chemical antiscalants could be reduced and considerable cost benefits realised. The effects of magnetic treatment on low temperature crystallisation of CaCO3 in a flow through system has been investigated. Magnetically induced changes were most apparent in sedimented scale provided that a significant magnetic field contact velocity (Vmf) had been obtained. This deposit, forming mostly as calcite under non magnetised conditions was modified to spherical grains displaying a characteristic form. Scale precipitating onto PVC pipe was also visibly altered, but only when a high strength magnetic field was applied to strongly supersaturated solution flowing with a sufficient velocity. Preliminary experiments were conducted using a magnetically treated feed in once through and recirculating RO systems operated under accelerated scaling conditions. The efficacy of the treatment was ascertained by analyses of flux and salt rejection decline during formation of the scale deposit with reference to a control system operating under the same physicochemical conditions. Destructive autopsy was also carried out on the membrane elements to deduce the nature and extent of the deposit. No change was evident in a once through system with a single magnetic exposure of the water. However under recirculation (and repeated exposure) the grain size of the deposit (precipitating exclusively as aragonite) was reproducibly increased. Improvements in salt rejection decline were occasionally evident due to this more porous deposit but no repeatable substantial improvement in flux decline was found. It was found that magnetic treatment was promoting enhanced precipitation (up to 10{\texttimes} more; depending upon experimental conditions) in the prefilter units. SEM analysis of the prefilter deposit indicated this had grown in situ rather than having been trapped by virtue of having increased particle size. Further work is needed to deduce ff these effects can be applicable to RO engineering situations.},

  abstract = {Process industry remains sceptical of antiscale magnetic treatment (AMT) despite its long history. Manufacturer's claims concerning AMT comprise: (a) a reduction in the amount of scale formed, (b) production of a less tenacious scale due to a change in its crystal morphology, (c) removal of existing scale, and (d) a retention of the antiscaling properties of the treated water for hours following treatment. Scientific research has both substantiated and refuted these claims, creating widespread controversy as to the credibility of this type of water conditioning. Positive results indicate effects on: (a) colloidal systems where aggregation is generally enhanced and (b) crystallisation where larger hydrophilic crystals, usually with modified crystal growth, are generated. Investigations have incorporated scaling kinetics, scale morphology, scale solubility, particle coagulation and corrosion. Effects have been reported for different scale-forming compounds and for various microscopic and macroscopic parameters in single-phase systems. AMT appears to be enhanced by prolonged or repeated magnetic exposure, and is more effective above a threshold magnetic field contact time and in flowing systems. Effects have been reported in treated waters up to 130 h after exposure has ceased. Industrial case studies indicate that the most successful implementations are in hot recirculating systems. Mechanisms presented to account for the observed effects comprise (a) intramolecular/intraionic interaction, (b) Lorentz force effects, (c) dissolution of contaminants, and (d) interfacial effects. The most plausible of these is the latter, in which the interaction of the magnetic field with the charged species present (ion clusters and crystallites) affects crystal nucleation and subsequent growth. The reported scale inhibition (and descaling) then occurs as a result of magnetically-produced hydrophilic discrete scale particles of substantially different size and crystal morphology to untreated systems, in which more adherent crystals are generated.},

Heat removal has become a crucial issue for continuing progress in the electronic industry, and thermal conduction in low-dimensional structures has revealed truly intriguing features. Carbon allotropes and their derivatives occupy a unique place in terms of their ability to conduct heat. The room-temperature thermal conductivity of carbon materials span an extraordinary large range --- of over five orders of magnitude --- from the lowest in amorphous carbons to the highest in graphene and carbon nanotubes. Here, I review the thermal properties of carbon materials focusing on recent results for graphene, carbon nanotubes and nanostructured carbon materials with different degrees of disorder. Special attention is given to the unusual size dependence of heat conduction in two-dimensional crystals and, specifically, in graphene. I also describe the prospects of applications of graphene and carbon materials for thermal management of electronics.},

The total permeate flux obtained is affected by two simultaneous resistances, those due to the heat and mass transfer processes which take place through the liquid phase and through the membrane respectively. On the other hand, the separation factor is highly sensitive to the mass transfer resistance existing within the liquid phase. Different applications have been considered such as extraction of organic components, degassing of water and evaporation of pure water. In all cases appropriate design equations for shell and tube equipment have been obtained and solved.

  abstract = {Vacuum membrane distillation is a membrane-based separation process considered here to remove volatile organic compounds from aqueous streams. Microporous hydrophobic membranes are used to separate the aqueous stream from a gas phase kept under vacuum. The evaporation of the liquid stream takes place on one side of the membrane, and mass transfer occurs through the vapor phase inside the membrane. The role of operative conditions on the process performance is widely investigated in the case of dilute binary aqueous mixtures containing acetone, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylacetate, methylacetate, or methylterbutyl ether. Temperature, composition, flow rate of the liquid feed, and pressure downstream the membrane are the main operative variables. Among these, the vacuum-side pressure is the major design factor since it greatly affects the separation efficiency. A mathematical model description of the process is developed, and the results are compared with the experiments. The model is finally used to predict the best operative conditions in which the process can work for the case of benzene removal from waste waters.},

Furthermore, the adhesion of contaminating particles is reduced. Based on experimental data carried out on microscopically smooth (Fagus sylvatica L., Gnetum gnemon L., Heliconia densiflora Verlot, Magnolia grandiflora L.) and rough water-repellent plants (Brassica oleracea L., Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott., Mutisia decurrens Cav., Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.), it is shown here for the first time that the interdependence between surface roughness, reduced particle adhesion and water repellency is the keystone in the self-cleaning mechanism of many biological surfaces. The plants were artificially contaminated with various particles and subsequently subjected to artificial rinsing by sprinkler or fog generator. In the case of water-repellent leaves, the particles were removed completely by water droplets that rolled off the surfaces independent of their chemical nature or size. The leaves of N. nucifera afford an impressive demonstration of this effect, which is, therefore, called the ''Lotus-Effect'' and which may be of great biological and technological importance.},

A formalism is proposed to predict the contact angle ({\texttheta}) of a droplet on the HCP films and penetration angle ({$\alpha$}) of the liquid on the spherical particles. Then, the extended Laplace pressure for the layered HCP ordering is calculated and a correlation between the wetting angle, sign of pressure, and pressure gradient is achieved. Our results show that the sign and the slope of pressure are important criteria for determining the wettability state and it is found that the contact angle is independent of the particle radius, as supported by various experimental reports. The pressure gradient for the HCP films with Young contact angle higher than (lower than) a critical contact angle, 135{$^\circ$} (45{$^\circ$}), is positive (negative), indicating the superhydrophobicity (superhydrophilicity) state of the surface. To validate the proposed formulation, theoretical calculations are compared with the reported experimental measurements, showing a good agreement.},

Typical situations include linear cellular automata where the states come from a finite field or a finite commutative ring, and so-called additive cellular automata in the case the states come from a finite commutative group and the cellular automaton is a group homomorphism. In this paper we generalize the setup and consider so-called group cellular automata whose state set is any (possibly non-commutative) finite group and the cellular automaton is a group homomorphism. The configuration space may be any subshift that is a subgroup of the full shift and still many properties are decidable in any dimension of the cellular space. Decidable properties include injectivity, surjectivity, equicontinuity, sensitivity and nilpotency. Non-transitivity is semi-decidable. It also turns out that the the trace shift and the limit set can be effectively constructed, that injectivity always implies surjectivity, and that jointly periodic points are dense in the limit set. Our decidability proofs are based on developing algorithms to manipulate arbitrary group shifts, and viewing the set of space-time diagrams of group cellular automata as multidimensional group shifts.},

  abstract = {Many decision problems concerning cellular automata are known to be decidable in the case of algebraic cellular automata, that is, when the state set has an algebraic structure and the automaton acts as a morphism. The most studied cases include finite fields, finite commutative rings and finite commutative groups. In this paper, we provide methods to generalize these results to the broader case of group cellular automata, that is, the case where the state set is a finite (possibly non-commutative) finite group. The configuration space is not even necessarily the full shift but a subshift -- called a group shift -- that is a subgroup of the full shift on Zd, for any number d of dimensions. We show, in particular, that injectivity, surjectivity, equicontinuity, sensitivity and nilpotency are decidable for group cellular automata, and non-transitivity is semidecidable. Injectivity always implies surjectivity, and jointly periodic points are dense in the limit set. The Moore direction of the Gardenof-Eden theorem holds for all group cellular automata, while the Myhill direction fails in some cases. The proofs are based on effective projection operations on group shifts that are, in particular, applied on the set of valid space-time diagrams of group cellular automata. This allows one to effectively construct the traces and the limit sets of group cellular automata.

  abstract = {The viscous sublayer of a turbulent boundary layer on a surface with fine longitudinal ribs (riblets) is investigated theoretically. The mean flow constituent of this viscous flow is considered. Using conformal mapping, the velocity distributions on various surface configurations are calculated. The geometries that were investigated include sawtooth profiles with triangular and trapezoidal grooves as well as profiles with thin blade-shaped ribs, ribs with rounded edges and ribs having sharp ridges and U-shaped grooves. (This latter riblet configuration is also found on the tiny scales of fast sharks.) Our calculations enable us to determine the location of the origin of the velocity profile that lies somewhat below the tips of the ridges. The distance between this origin and the tip of the ridge we call `protrusion height'. The upper limit for the protrusion height is found to be 22\% of the lateral rib spacing; the coefficient 0.22 being the value of the expression {$\pi-$}1 In 2. This limit is valid for two-dimensional riblet geometries. Analogous experiments with an electrolytic tank are carried out as an additional check on the theoretical calculations. This is also an easy way to determine experimentally the location of the origin of the velocity profile for arbitrary new riblet geometries. A possible connection between protrusion height and drag reduction in a turbulent boundary layer flow is discussed. Finally, the present theory also produces an orthogonal grid pattern above riblet surfaces which may be utilized in future numerical calculations of the whole turbulent boundary layer.},

  abstract = {The development of accurate and fast modeling tools to predict the performance of direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) modules can result in their performance improvement. Conventional models ignoring the variations of operational parameters along the membrane's length may cause inaccuracy. Moreover, models considering these variations are often complex and computationally expensive. To propose an accurate and fast modeling tool, the possibility of using machine learning models for the performance prediction of the DCMD module has been studied for the first time in this study. The robustness of three machine learning models (ANN, SVR, and RF) has been thoroughly compared with the stepwise mechanistic modeling approach in terms of models' accuracy, trend predictability, and computational time. The results show that ANN and SVR models exhibit an enhanced performance over the mechanistic model, possessing a MAPEtest of 3.46\% and 4.78\% as compared to the mechanistic model with a MAPEtest of 7.31\%. Further, compared to the mechanistic model, the machine learning models have the privilege of simplicity, enhanced accuracy, and significantly lowered computational time. The feature importance analysis also showed that the feed flow temperature is the most influencing parameter on permeate flux in the DCMD system.},

  abstract = {Biomineral formation is widespread in nature, and occurs in bacteria, single-celled protists, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Minerals formed in the biological environment often show unusual physical properties (e.g. strength, degree of hydration) and often have structures that exhibit order on many length scales. Biosilica, found in single-celled organisms through to higher plants and primitive animals (sponges), is formed from an environment that is undersaturated with respect to silicon, and under conditions of approximately neutral pH and relatively low temperatures of 4-40 degrees C compared to those used industrially. Formation of the mineral may occur intracellularly or extracellularly, and specific biochemical locations for mineral deposition that include lipids, proteins and carbohydrates are known. In most cases, the formation of the mineral phase is linked to cellular processes, an understanding of which could lead to the design of new materials for biomedical, optical and other applications. In this contribution, we describe the aqueous chemistry of silica, from uncondensed monomers through to colloidal particles and 3D structures, that is relevant to the environment from which the biomineral forms. We then describe the chemistry of silica formation from alkoxides such as tetraethoxysilane, as this and other silanes have been used to study the chemistry of silica formation using silicatein, and such precursors are often used in the preparation of silicas for technological applications. The focus of this article is on the methods, experimental and computational, by which the process of silica formation can be studied, with an emphasis on speciation.},

  abstract = {Silica is one of the major constituents of underground water utilized in geothermal energy conversion. High silica concentrations in the brine result in tenacious silica scale formation in heat exchangers used in the energy conversion. It has long been hypothesized that magnetic water treatment is an effective means of reducing this scale buildup. The purpose of this study is to investigate polymerization and deposition characteristics of simulated brine solutions to see if they can in any way be altered by the application of a strong magnetic field, thereby helping to support or refute the magnetic water treatment hypothesis. Infrared transmission data and polymerization studies of various samples are presented to indicate that a stationary magnetic field (1200 gauss) had no apprciable effect on the physical structure and polymerization reaction rates respectively. However, it was discovered both with and without the magnetic field, that small traces of iron (Fe++) were found to strongly reduce the polymerization rates of supersaturated silica solutions. A hypothesis is presented to explain how magnetic fields may indirectly reduce scale buildup by introducing higher amounts of iron by increased corrosion.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the importance of non-woven support (NWS) during the preparation of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes for membrane distillation (MD). Five different NWSs were investigated as substrate materials for composite membranes. Additionally, a series of unsupported membranes were also tested. Unsupported membranes were found vulnerable to shrinkage that constricted and diminished their pores, rendering them unsuitable for MD. The NWS provides sufficient strength for a composite membrane, thanks to its stiffness, thus limiting membrane shrinkage which occurred severely in unsupported membranes. However, some composite membranes were also found vulnerable to shrinkage and defect when cast on a weak NWS. Shrinkage level worsened at higher casting thicknesses, higher polymer concentrations and when the NWS was prewetted before casting. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of NWS selection and casting thickness optimization. High elastic modulus is the first criteria for NWS selection to avoid membrane shrinkage and defects. Optimizing the casting thickness is also vital for obtaining defect free composite membranes with high MD flux. Since MD flux is inversely proportional to net membrane thickness, low casting thickness increases the flux. However, thin casting imposes vulnerability with respect to membrane defect which can lead to membrane wetting.},

CFD simulations were used to investigate the impact of the geometric parameters of spacers on pressure loss and concentration polarization in membrane channels. Spacer designs were characterized using six parameters that were varied in simulations to sample the domain of commercially available designs. Machine learning models were trained on CFD data to produce surrogate models for predicting pressure loss and mass transfer coefficients. These surrogate models consider more geometric parameters than existing empirical equations resulting in more representative and flexible models that can be integrated into existing module-scale or system-scale modeling software. Surrogate models were coupled with a particle swarm optimization algorithm and found that spacer designs with a diameter of 0.3~mm, length of 3.6~mm, angle between 42 and 46{$^\circ$}, and moderate diameter necking ({\textasciitilde}60~\%) best balances the trade-off between reduced concentration polarization and increased pressure losses in membrane channels with channel velocities between 0.05 and 0.35~m/s.},

  abstract = {The role of multiscale (hierarchical) roughness in optimizing the structure of nonwettable (superhydrophobic) solid surfaces was theoretically studied for 2D systems of a drop on three different types of surface topographies with up to four roughness scales. The surface models considered here were sinusoidal, flat-top pillars, and triadic Koch curves. Three criteria were used to compare between the various topographies and roughness scales. The first is the transition contact angle (CA) between the Wenzel (W) and Cassie--Baxter (CB) wetting states, above which the CB state is the thermodynamically stable one. The second is the solid--liquid (wetted) interfacial area, as an indicator for the ease of roll-off of a drop from the superhydrophobic surfaces. The third is the protrusion height that reflects the mechanical stability of the surface against breakage. The results indicate that multiscale roughness per se is not essential for superhydrophobicity; however, it mainly decreases the necessary protrusion height. Thus, multiscale roughness is beneficial for the Lotus effect mostly with regard to mechanical stability. The sinusoidal topography with three levels of roughness scales is best for nonwettability out of the topographies studied here. This observation may partially explain why Nature chose rounded-top protrusions, such as those on the Lotus leaf. The least useful topography is the flat-top pillars with three roughness scales. In the case of the triadic Koch topography, four roughness scales are required to have nonwettable surface.},

However, hydrophobic MD membranes are prone to wetting by low surface tension substances, thereby limiting their use in treating challenging industrial wastewaters, such as shale gas produced water. In this study, we present a facile and scalable approach for the fabrication of omniphobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes that repel both water and oil. Positive surface charge was imparted to an alkaline-treated PVDF membrane by aminosilane functionalization, which enabled irreversible binding of negatively charged silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) to the membrane through electrostatic attraction. The membrane with grafted SiNPs was then coated with fluoroalkylsilane (perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane) to lower the membrane surface energy. Results from contact angle measurements with mineral oil and surfactant solution demonstrated that overlaying SiNPs with ultralow surface energy significantly enhanced the wetting resistance of the membrane against low surface tension liquids. We also evaluated desalination performance of the modified membrane in direct contact membrane distillation with a synthetic wastewater containing surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and mineral oil, as well as with shale gas produced water. The omniphobic membrane exhibited a stable MD performance, demonstrating its potential application for desalination of challenging industrial wastewaters containing diverse low surface tension contaminants.},

  abstract = {A novel route has been developed to synthesize polypyrrole (PPy)/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposites via liquid/liquid interfacial polymerization where GO and initiator was dispersed in the aquous phase and the monomer was dissolved in the organic phase. The synthesized samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), ultravioletevisible absorption (UVevis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electrochemical and electrical conductivity measurements. A good dispersion of the GO sheets within the PPy matrix was observed from the morphological analysis. The composites exhibited noticeable improvement in thermal stability and electrical conductivity in comparison to pure polypyrrole. The composites showed excellent electrochemical reversibility at the scan rate of 0.1 V/s and good cyclic stability even up to 100th cycle. Newly developed graphene oxide based polypyrrole composite could be applied in electrochemical energy storage device.},

  abstract = {We studied the phase diagram for the TIP4P/Ice water model using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach is based on the calculation of ice--liquid free energy differences from biased coexistence simulations that reversibly sample the melting and growth of layers of ice. We computed a total of 19 melting points for five different ice polymorphs, which are in excellent agreement with the melting lines obtained from the integration of the Clausius--Clapeyron equation. For proton-ordered and fully proton-disordered ice phases, the results are in very good agreement with previous calculations based on thermodynamic integration. For the partially proton-disordered ice III, we find a large increase in stability that is in line with previous observations using direct coexistence simulations for the TIP4P/2005 model. This issue highlights the robustness of the approach employed here for ice polymorphs with diverse degrees of proton disorder. Our approach is general and can be applied to the calculation of other complex phase diagrams.},

  abstract = {Secondary nucleation is ubiquitous in nature and of fundamental importance for both batch and continuous crystallization processes. Attrition is the mechanism through which fragments are formed after the collision of a crystal with a stirrer. Those fine fragments, if small enough, are considered secondary nuclei. In this work, starting from the mechanistic description of attrition by Gahn and Mersmann (Crystallization Technology Handbook; CRC Press, 2001), two population balance equation models to simulate secondary nucleation processes have been derived. The first simulates attrition as a breakage term, and growth rate is the result of size-dependent solubility. The second model considers attrition as a boundary condition at zero crystal size, where the expression for secondary nucleation rate already takes into account the effect of supersaturation, while the growth rate is size-independent. The two models are proven equivalent in the growth regime, thus where secondary nucleation and growth are the dominant phenomena. At extremely low values of supersaturation, thanks to size-dependent solubility, the first model yields to further development of the crystal population, e.g., ripening and aging. The main result is that secondary nucleation by attrition can be described as a birth/death term or, alternatively, as a source term according to the final application of the model. Since the two approaches have very different computational intensities, one can choose the right model based on the objective of the simulation study. The evolution of the crystal population for high values of supersaturation will be the same in both cases.},

  abstract = {Computational analysis, modeling, and prediction of many phenomena in materials require a three-dimensional (3D) microstructure sample that embodies the salient features of the material system under study. Since acquiring 3D microstructural images is expensive and time-consuming, an alternative approach is to extrapolate a 2D image (aka exemplar) into a virtual 3D sample and thereafter use the 3D image in the analyses and design. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and novel approach based on transfer learning to accomplish this extrapolation-based reconstruction for a wide range of microstructures including alloys, porous media, and polycrystalline. We cast the reconstruction task as an optimization problem where a random 3D image is iteratively refined to match its microstructural features to those of the exemplar. VGG19, a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, constitutes the backbone of this optimization where it is used to obtain the microstructural features and construct the objective function. By augmenting the architecture of VGG19 with a permutation operator, we enable it to take 3D images as inputs and generate a collection of 2D features that approximate an underlying 3D feature map. We demonstrate the applications of our approach with nine examples on various microstructure samples and image types (grayscale, binary, and RGB). As measured by independent statistical metrics, our approach ensures the statistical equivalency between the 3D reconstructed samples and the corresponding 2D exemplar quite well.

The governing operative model for mass transfer was investigated. The measured flux has been well predicted by the Knudsen-molecular mechanism model. The effects on the DCMD flux of polarization phenomena TP and CP were underlined. The optimum operating parameters were defined: the hot and cold stream temperatures were set, respectively at 59 and 20{$^\circ$}C, and the feed and permeate velocities were fixed both to 0.046ms-1. With regard to membrane performance to treat the reverse osmosis brine, a long-term experiment was carried out under the optimal experimental conditions. The increase in feed RO brine concentration provoked a noticeably decrease in flux from 8.43 to 4.06kgm-2h-1. The RO brine experiments proved that the DCMD process was capable to concentrate the solution tell to reach concentration factor (CF) further than four times, which corresponded to the super-saturation of saline solution. Based on the characterization methods, the occurrence of the membrane wetting and scaling was shown and interpreted. These extreme phenomena promote the salt crystallization on the feed side of the membrane. The onset crystallization phenomenon starts when the permeate decreases so fast. Their sudden decline was about 90\% for a working period of 20h.},

With PVF, the addition of small quantities of tetrabutylammonium bromide to an aqueous solution or the replacement of an aqueous with an alcoholic solution resulted in much more rapid treatment under a given set of conditions. Effective treatments of just 30 and 10s were developed for PVF and PVdF, respectively. Substantial changes in surface chemistry were observed using XPS for most of the pretreatment conditions used; the changes were mainly in the form of defluorination plus introduction of oxygen. The changes were most marked for PVdF treated with solutions containing a small amount of TBAB. Elimination reactions are likely to be of particular importance with PVdF, a view supported by the existence of CC and CC bonds. Substantial chemical modification of PVF did not necessarily result in large increases in adhesion. This is attributed to the chemical modification of a weak boundary layer without its removal.},

Hybrid high-performance computers, machines with more than one type of floating-point processor, are now becoming more prevalent due to these advantages. In this work, we discuss several important issues in porting a large molecular dynamics code for use on parallel hybrid machines - (1) choosing a hybrid parallel decomposition that works on central processing units (CPUs) with distributed memory and accelerator cores with shared memory, (2) minimizing the amount of code that must be ported for efficient acceleration, (3) utilizing the available processing power from both multi-core CPUs and accelerators, and (4) choosing a programming model for acceleration. We present our solution to each of these issues for short-range force calculation in the molecular dynamics package LAMMPS, however, the methods can be applied in many molecular dynamics codes. Specifically, we describe algorithms for efficient short range force calculation on hybrid high-performance machines. We describe an approach for dynamic load balancing of work between CPU and accelerator cores. We describe the Geryon library that allows a single code to compile with both CUDA and OpenCL for use on a variety of accelerators.

Hybrid high-performance computers, defined as machines with nodes containing more than one type of floating-point processor (e.g. CPU and GPU), are now becoming more prevalent due to these advantages. Although there has been extensive research into methods to use accelerators efficiently to improve the performance of molecular dynamics (MD) codes employing pairwise potential energy models, little is reported in the literature for models that include many-body effects. 3-body terms are required for many popular potentials such as MEAM, Tersoff, REBO, AIREBO, Stillinger-Weber, Bond-Order Potentials, and others. Because the per-atom simulation times are much higher for models incorporating 3-body terms, there is a clear need for efficient algorithms usable on hybrid high performance computers. Here, we report a shared-memory force-decomposition for 3-body potentials that avoids memory conflicts to allow for a deterministic code with substantial performance improvements on hybrid machines. We describe modifications necessary for use in distributed memory MD codes and show results for the simulation of water with Stillinger-Weber on the hybrid Titan supercomputer. We compare performance of the 3-body model to the SPC/E water model when using accelerators. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can attain a speedup of 5.1 with acceleration on Titan for production simulations to study water droplet freezing on a surface. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Geothermal energy is heat energy generated and stored in the Earth, accumulated in hydrothermal systems or in dry rocks within the Earth's crust, in amounts which constitute the energy resources. The sustainable management of geothermal energy resources should be geared towards optimization of energy recovery, but also towards rational management of water resources since geothermal water serves both as energy carrier and also as valuable raw material. Geothermal waters, depending on their hydrogeothermal characteristics, the lithology of the rocks involved, the depth at which the resources occur and the sources of water supply, may be characterized by very diverse physicochemical parameters. This factor largely determines the technology to be used in their exploitation and the way the geothermal water can be used. This book is focused on the effective use of geothermal water and renewable energy for future needs in order to promote modern, sustainable and effective management of water resources.  The research field includes crucial new areas of study: {$\bullet$} an improvement in the management of freshwater resources through the use of residual geothermal water; {$\bullet$} a review of the technologies available in the field of geothermal water treatment for its (re)use for energetic purposes and freshwater production, and {$\bullet$} the development of balneotherapy. The book is aimed at professionals, academics and decision makers worldwide, water sector representatives and administrators, business enterprises specializing in renewable energy management and water treatment, working in the areas of geothermal energy usage, water resources, water supply and energy planning. This book has the potential to become a standard text used by educational institutions and research \& development establishments involved in the geothermal water management.},

  abstract = {In this work, an overview of the interconnections between membrane technology and renewable energy sources (biomass, salinity gradient power, wind, solar) is given. Regarding biomass, membrane processes such as membrane reactors and bio-reactors, membrane contactors, membrane distillation in the logic of process intensification strategy may be opportunely integrated in the production processes of green fuels. Their advantages such as reduction of the separation load and stage number, improved yields and selectivities compared to conventional processes imply low direct energy consumption, lower footprint area occupied by the processes plants. Moreover, the possibility of integration these advanced membrane processes with other traditional membrane operations such as microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO), pervaporation (PV) allows the reduction of indirect energy consumption through the recycling and reuse of raw materials and secondary materials minimizing the formation of wastes. Both Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO) and Reversed Electra Dialysis (RED), the only two technologies for which salinity gradient power-based demonstration projects are running, use membranes. In this article, key points and challenges to be faced for both PRO and RED are reported. On the other side, membrane desalination plants, are more often considered excellent locations to install wind and solar power generators. Most advanced research in the field is focused on solar assisted membrane distillation (MD). In the logic of fully "sustainable desalination", highly innovative technologies such as Microbial desalination cells (MDCs) could be integrated as pre-treatment stage in membrane desalination plants in remote, arid regions.

It discusses the transport properties of mixtures that can be applied in membrane systems and describes the permeation and separation in real but simple porous membrane systems, with a focus on operational applicability. It also discusses the validity of the important approximations of important problems and opportunities, and of some models. The most promising systems to obtain high selectivity in combination with reasonable permeation values are focused.},

Depending on experimental conditions, this may increase or decrease turbulence in the fluid, promoting aggregation or deaggregation of both ferromagnetic and diamagnetic colloids. Important factors in promoting magnetohydrodynamic forces on fluid flow include conductivity of the solution, linear flow velocity of the fluid, and the flux density (magnetic induction) of the transverse field. Finally, magnetic treatment devices that are physically designed to create additional turbulence by constricting or otherwise altering fluid flow may further enhance the anti-scaling effect by purely mechanical means.},

  abstract = {Membrane scaling by silica is a major challenge in desalination, particularly for inland desalination of brackish groundwater or geothermal water, which often contain high concentrations of silica and dissolved solids. Adjustment of feed pH may reduce silica scaling risk, which is important for inland facilities that operate at high water recoveries to reduce brine disposal costs. However, water recovery of reverse osmosis is also limited due to increased osmotic pressure with feed water concentration. Membrane distillation (MD) is a thermally driven membrane desalination technique that is not limited by increased osmotic pressure of the feed. In this investigation, pH adjustment was tested as a strategy to reduce silica scaling risk in the MD process. With feed water pH less than 5 or higher than 10, scaling impacts were negligible at silica concentrations up to 600 mg/L. Scaling rates were highest at neutral pH between 6 and 8. Cleaning strategies were also explored to remove silica scale from membranes. Cleaning using NaOH solutions at pH higher than 11 to induce dissolution of silica scale was effective at temporarily restoring performance; however, some silica remained on membrane surfaces and scaling upon re-exposure to supersaturated silica concentrations occurred faster than with new membranes.},

  abstract = {A diverse spectrum of technology drivers such as improved thermal barriers, higher efficiency thermoelectric energy conversion, phase-change memory, heat-assisted magnetic recording, thermal management of nanoscale electronics, and nanoparticles for thermal medical therapies are motivating studies of the applied physics of thermal transport at the nanoscale. This review emphasizes developments in experiment, theory, and computation in the past ten years and summarizes the present status of the field. Interfaces become increasingly important on small length scales. Research during the past decade has extended studies of interfaces between simple metals and inorganic crystals to interfaces with molecular materials and liquids with systematic control of interface chemistry and physics. At separations on the order of   {$\sim$} 1 \, nm  , the science of radiative transport through nanoscale gaps overlaps with thermal conduction by the coupling of electronic and vibrational excitations across weakly bonded or rough interfaces between materials. Major advances in the physics of phonons include first principles calculation of the phonon lifetimes of simple crystals and application of the predicted scattering rates in parameter-free calculations of the thermal conductivity. Progress in the control of thermal transport at the nanoscale is critical to continued advances in the density of information that can be stored in phase change memory devices and new generations of magnetic storage that will use highly localized heat sources to reduce the coercivity of magnetic media. Ultralow thermal conductivity---thermal conductivity below the conventionally predicted minimum thermal conductivity---has been observed in nanolaminates and disordered crystals with strong anisotropy. Advances in metrology by time-domain thermoreflectance have made measurements of the thermal conductivity of a thin layer with micron-scale spatial resolution relatively routine. Scanning thermal microscopy and thermal analysis using proximal probes has achieved spatial resolution of 10\,nm, temperature precision of 50 mK, sensitivity to heat flows of 10 pW, and the capability for thermal analysis of sub-femtogram samples.},

The water is more stable by magnetic treatment with less molecular energy and more activation energy, as shown from the calculation based on the results. The correlation time {$\tau$}c was calculated in terms of spin--lattice relaxation time of proton NMR, which verified that the rotational motions got slow down after magnetic treatments.

Crystallization and fouling on the membrane surface are important issues during a membrane distillation process, which significantly affect its separation performance. Crystallization precipitation is a gradual process along the normal direction of the membrane and the feed flow direction. It is not easy to observe the gradual behavior in a relatively small module with a short flow distance in common lab scale modules. In this work, a long-distance membrane distillation module ({\textasciitilde}2~m in length) was designed and set up to investigate the gradual evolutionary process of crystallization fouling on the porous membrane. A practical model was proposed to estimate the approximate position of crystallization fouling in a long-distance membrane distillation process based on multiple factors including operating parameters and intrinsic membrane properties. A set of proof-of-principle experiments were proceeded to observe and characterize the crystallization fouling behaviors on the membrane surface and inside the pores under various conditions. Furthermore, to re-functionalize the membrane distillation system with the membrane fully covered by salt crystals, flushing the system with pure water was applied. The performance of the re-functionalized system was also investigated.},

Within the past five to seven years, building on remarkable advances in the synthesis of nanoscale photothermal materials, significant progress has been made in the design and fabrication of solar evaporators. Here, we comprehensively review the materials and structures of the three key components of solar evaporators: solar absorbers, substrates (i.e., support layers), and water collectors towards efficient harvesting of sunlight, thermal management, water transportation, interfacial evaporation, and collection. In particular, we discuss the design principles of water collectors for solar-driven evaporation, which are in the early stages of development at present. Furthermore, bio-inspired water collectors provide exciting opportunities for the design and realization of efficient water harvesting from solar steam. Finally, we introduce photothermal-enhanced membrane distillation (PMD), a promising alternative technique involving solar-driven interfacial evaporation for producing clean water. PMD combines solar energy and membrane distillation, which facilitates efficient water purification and collection. In this review, we discuss the design guidelines and recent development of this photothermal-enhanced water purification. This review provides useful insights into the material choice and structure optimization to realize enhanced solar evaporators towards freshwater generation.},

In particular, photothermally driven membrane distillation (PMD) is a highly promising solar-driven desalination technology, especially in remote regions and disaster-struck communities, where no power infrastructure or waste heat from industrial plants is available. MXene, more specifically Ti3C2Tx, with excellent photothermal properties, easy processability, and electrical conductivity offers a great opportunity for realizing highly efficient, stable and multifunctional PMD membranes. Herein, we realize a MXene composite aerogel comprised of hydroxyapatite nanowires and poly(vinyl alcohol) with high thermal efficiency (61\%) and water flux (0.72 kg m(-2) h(-1)) under 0.8 sun irradiation (0.8 kW m(-2)), representing the first validation of highly efficient MXene-based PMD systems in treating ambient saline water. Owing to the strong interfacial interaction (i.e., hydrogen bonding) between the building blocks, the MXene composite aerogel with high porosity (up to 91\%) exhibited excellent mechanical stability. This highly interconnected porous network offers low resistance to vapor transport and low thermal conductivity, which minimizes conductive heat transfer across the aerogel, thus maximizing the thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the outstanding bactericidal activity induced by solar irradiation or electric potential makes the MXene composite aerogel a highly attractive candidate for PMD in the real world.},

  abstract = {Osmotically-driven membrane processes, including forward osmosis (FO) and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO), are emerging technologies that have come under renewed interest and subjected to numerous investigations in recent years. In FO, water is extracted from a feed solution utilizing the high osmotic pressure of a concentrated draw solution (DS) that flows on the opposite side of an FO membrane; RO or a distillation process can be utilized to reconcentrate the DS for reuse in the FO process and to produce purified water. The main advantages of FO include operation at very low hydraulic pressures, high rejection of a broad range of contaminants, and lower membrane fouling propensity than in pressure-driven membrane processes. Existing and potential applications of the osmosis phenomenon extend from water treatment and food processing to power generation and novel methods for controlled drug release. While FO relies on osmotic pressure driving force to separate water from a feed streams, thermally driven membrane processes, such as membrane distillation (MD), rely on vapor pressure difference across a microporous hydrophobic membranes to facilitate separation of volatile solvent (water from salt solution) or volatile solutes from impaired feed streams. The vapor pressure gradient is usually achieved by maintaining temperature difference between a warm feed solution and a colder distillate that flow on the opposite side of the membrane. In thermally-driven membrane processes, desalination and production of highly-purified water can be achieved in one step compared to osmotically-driven membrane processes, at much lower temperatures compared to distillation processes, and at much lower pressures compared to pressure-driven membrane processes. It can be most effectively and beneficially used when low-grade heat is readily available. Furthermore, compared to other membrane processes, in MD the salinity of the feed stream minimally affects the driving force for mass transport through the membrane; salts, even at high concentrations, only slightly reduce the partial vapor pressure of such feed streams. Thus, MD can be beneficially used to enhance water recovery in many desalination processes. In this paper, a brief review of the principles of FO and MD is provided. Special aspects of mass transport as well as the membranes used in the processes are discussed, and relevant results from recent studies are presented. Strengths and limitations of the FO and MD processes in a broad spectrum of applications are reviewed and discussed.},

  abstract = {Neural cellular automata have been proven effective in simulating morphogenetic processes. Developing such automata has been applied in 2D and 3D processes related to creating and regenerating complex structures and enabling their behaviors. However, neural cellular automata are inherently uncontrollable after the training process. Starting from a neural cellular automaton trained to generate a given shape from one living cell, this paper aims to gain insight into the behavior of the automaton, and to analyze the influence of the different image characteristics on the training and stabilization process and its shortcomings in different scenarios. For each considered shape, the automaton is trained on one RGB image of size 72 {\textbackslash}times 72 pixels containing the shape on an uniform white background, in which each pixel represents a cell. The evolution of the automaton starts from one living cell, employing a shallow neural network for the update rule, followed by backpropagation after a variable number of evolutionary steps. We studied the behavior of the automaton and the way in which different components like symmetry, orientation and colours of the shape influence its growth and alteration after a number of epochs and discussed this thoroughly in the experimental section of the paper. We further discuss a pooling strategy, used to stabilize the model and illustrate the influence of this pooling on the training process. The benefits of this strategy are compared to the original model and the behavior of the automaton during its evolution is studied in detail. Finally, we compare the results of models using different filters in the first stage of feature selection. The main results of our study are the insights gained into how the neural cellular automaton works, what it is actually learning, and what influence this learning, as there are observable result differences depending on the characteristics of the input images and the filters used in the model.},

The C/P blend membranes appeared to be more hydrophilic, with a higher pure water flux than the polyethersulfone (PES) membranes. It was also found that the amount of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in the blend membranes was an important factor affecting the morphology and permeation properties of the membranes. After 24~h of surface water filtration with 7~mgC/L TOC content, the C/P blend membranes displayed a higher flux and slower fouling rate than the PES membranes. Subsequent analyses of the desorbed foulants showed that the amount of foulant on bare PES membranes was 63\% higher than the C/P blend membrane for 2\% MWCNTs content. Thus, the carbon nanotube content of the C/P membranes was shown to alleviate the membrane fouling caused by natural water.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is an emerging technology for the desalination of brines. In some cases, liquid penetrates into the pores of the membrane, causing pore wetting. MD's commer\- cialization is hindered largely due to the occurrence of pore wetting phenomena since it results in the reduction of flux and/or permeate quality. Hence, it is of crucial importance for MD to prevent pore wetting from occurring. In this paper, the methods of detecting pore wetting and the membrane parameters related to this phenomenon are reviewed and possible sources of MD pore wetting occurrence are identified. Moreover, the methods to prepare membranes specifically designed for the mitigation of membrane wetting, such as the design of membrane materials, membrane surface modification, preparation of nanocomposite membranes by the addition of nanoparticles, dual-layered membranes, and membranes with a re-entrant structure are dis\- cussed. Finally, process-based approach for wetting mitigation, mainly by the pretreatment of the feed solution, is elucidated, and models for wetting phenomena are also outlined. Thus, attempts are made in this review to discuss all aspects of the pore wetting of MD membranes.},

While there has been a great deal of focus on graphene aerogels, reports of 3D printed conventional carbon aerogels (CAs) are sparse. Activated CAs are particularly compelling because in addition to having a lower cost than a comparable graphene aerogel, they can achieve much higher surface areas ({$>$}3000 m2 g-1). Herein we report a 3D printable ink based on traditional resorcinol--formaldehyde sol--gel chemistry that can produce a final activated carbon aerogel with surface areas approaching 2000 m2 g-1 and good electrical conductivities ({$\sim$}200 S m-1). Direct ink writing (DIW) is used to then fabricate electrodes, which demonstrate excellent electrochemical properties with a high specific capacitance of 215 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 83\% capacitive retention at higher current densities (10 A g-1). The DIW electrode significantly outperformed its bulk counterpart and provides an example of how one can use 3D printed aerogel electrodes to overcome mass transport limitations and boost energy storage performance.},

The simulations employ the F3C (flexible three centered) water model and investigate electrolyte solutions with both low (1M) and high (5M) NaCl concentrations. The results show that the self-diffusion coefficient of the water molecules decreases in a low-concentration solution as the magnetic field intensity is increased, but increases in a high-concentration solution. The magnetic field enhances the mobility of the Na+ and Cl- ions in both low- and high-concentration solutions. The average number of hydrogen bonds increases when the magnetic field is applied to pure water or to a solution with a low NaCl concentration, but decreases in a solution with a high-concentration. The results show that the enhanced mobility of the ions under a magnetic field causes serious damage to the hydrogen bond network in the high-concentration solution. Conversely, in the low-concentration solution, the structural behavior is dominated by the properties of the water molecules, and hence the hydrogen bonding ability is enhanced as the magnetic field is increased.},

However, due to the lack of adequate interaction force between GO and MX nanosheets, it is challenging to construct a high strength and long-range ordered GO/MX aerogel, resulting in inferior mechanical properties and poor conductivity. Here, a facile gelation strategy is developed to form long-range ordered GO/MX aerogel by ethylenediamine (EDA) induced selfassembly of MX and GO liquid crystals (LCs). In this system, EDA plays dual roles of inducing ordered selfassembly of GO LCs nanosheets and strengthening interaction between GO and MX nanosheets. As a result, the obtained GO/MX aerogel with long-range ordered microstructure presents an outstanding mechanical elasticity of 9.5 kPa and a high conductivity of 0.99 S m 1. Especially, the assembled GO/MX-based sensor has an extremely low detection limit of {\textasciitilde} 0.2\% strain, prominent physiological signal capture capability, and excellent durability over 10,000 compression/release cycles. This work paves the way for the potential applications of GO/ MX composite aerogel in real-time human motion monitor, artificial skins, and flexible smart devices.},

  abstract = {A facile nanoscale phase separation method has been proposed for the fabrication of slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPSs). This method, however, suffered from the fact that high transmittance was unable to be achieved because it was difficult to control the surface roughness, film thickness, and optical properties. Moreover, membrane prepared by this method exhibited a low surface roughness, and organic droplets stuck to the SLIPSs prepared in several conditions. In this work, an improved process emphasizing the fluorinated alkyl silane (FAS) modification of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) was developed for the fabrication of competent SLIPSs. By using an aminosilane and a fluorinated alkyl silane in the first and the second modification steps, respectively, the hydrophobicity of the copolymer was shown to be effectively enhanced. Much better and reproducible SLIPSs can then be fabricated by the extremely simple process using non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) of PVDF-HFP/di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) solutions. The as-fabricated SLIPSs exhibited extreme liquid repellency as signified by very low sliding angles (less than 4A degrees for droplet volume of 5 mu l) against seven pure liquids (water, pentadecane, nonane, octane, heptane, hexane, and pentane) with surface tension values ranging from 72.8 to 17.2 mN/m. Furthermore, high optical transmittance (average transmittance = 92.9\%) of the self-standing omniphobic thin film may find its applications among others in self-cleaning solar cells with minor deterioration in their conversion efficiency.},

  abstract = {Wearable pressure sensors are in great demand with the rapid development of intelligent electronic devices. However, it is still a huge challenge to obtain high-performance pressure sensors with high sensitivity, wide response range, and low detection limit simultaneously. Here, a polyimide (PI)/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite aerogel with the merits of superelastic, high porosity, robust, and high-temperature resistance was successfully prepared through the freeze drying plus thermal imidization process. Benefiting from the strong chemical interactions between PI and CNT and stable electrical property, the composite aerogel exhibits versatile and superior brilliant sensing performance, which includes wide sensing range (80\% strain, 61 kPa), ultrahigh sensitivity (11.28 kPa--1), ultralow detection limit (0.1\% strain, {$<$}10 Pa), fast response time (50 ms) and recovery time (70 ms), remarkable long-term stability (1000 cycles), and exceptional detection ability toward different deformations (compression, distortion, and bending). Furthermore, the composite aerogel also shows stable sensing performance after annealing under different high temperatures and good thermal insulation property, making it workable in various harsh environments. As a result, the composite aerogel is suitable for the full-range human motion detection (including airflow, pulse, vocal cord vibration, and human movement) and precise detection of the pressure distribution when it is assembled into E-skin, demonstrating its great potential to serve as a high-performance wearable pressure sensor.},

  abstract = {Robust omniphobic membranes with simultaneous anti-wetting and anti-scaling properties have been developed for membrane distillation (MD) processes by means of (1) heat-pressing the electrospun nanofibrous membranes at 170 degrees C for 15 min with a light force and (2) dip coating the membranes with a low-concentration Teflon AF 2400 solution. The resultant omniphobic slippery (OMNI-SLIP) MD membrane displayed high CAs towards various liquids including water (148.41 +/- 1.50 degrees), glycerol (143.13 +/- 2.39 degrees), ethylene glycol (EG) (134.16 +/- 1.76 degrees), silicone oil (117.02 +/- 2.47 degrees), toluene (112.67 +/- 2.46 degrees) and ethanol (101.75 +/- 4.56 degrees), and a low sliding angle (10.79 +/- 1.63 degrees) towards water. The OMNI-SLIP membrane not only showed stable MD performance in wetting experiments with the presence of up to 0.4 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 90h but also retarded the CaSO4 scaling due to the combinative effects of the re-entrant structure provided by electrospun nanofibers and the low surface energy offered by the Teflon AF2400 coating. Detailed mechanisms about the improved wetting and scaling resistance have been elucidated. This study may provide useful insights for material and structural design of MD membranes to treat wastewater with a complex composition.},

  abstract = {Conductive hydrogels have attracted extensive interest owing to its potential in soft robotics, electronic skin, and human monitoring. However, insufficient mechanical properties, lower adhesivity, and unsatisfactory conductivity seriously hinder potential applications in this emerging field. Herein, a highly elastic conductive hydrogel with a combination of favorable mechanical properties, self-adhesiveness, and excellent electrical performance was achieved by the synergistic effect of aminated lignin (AL), polydopamine (PDA), polyacrylamide (PAM) chains, and biomass carbon aerogel (C-SPF). In detail, AL was applied to induce slow oxidative polymerization of DA for preparing the sticky hydrogel containing PDA. Then, C-SPF carbon aerogel was used as a matrix to construct a dual-network structured composite hydrogel by combining with the hydrogels derived from PDA, AL, and PAM. The as-prepared conductive hydrogel displayed excellent mechanical performance, strong adhesive strength, and repeatable adhesivity. The prepared hydrogel-based pressure sensor possessed fast response (0.6 s loading and 0.8 s unloading stress time), high response (maximum RCR = 1.8 {\texttimes} 104), wide working pressure range (from 0 to 240.0 kPa), and excellent durability (stable 500 compression cycles with 30\% deformation). In addition, the prepared sensor also displayed ultrahigh sensitivity (170 kPa--1), which was near 4 orders of magnitude higher than the conventional lignin-modified PAM hydrogels. The multiple interactions between hydrogel components and the mechanical properties of hydrogel were also verified by molecular dynamics investigation. Moreover, the excellent cytocompatibility and antibacterial activity of this composite hydrogel ensured high potential in various applications such as human/machine interaction, artificial intelligence, personal healthcare, and wearable devices.},

In this work, the thermal transport of a single-walled C3NNT is investigated in comparison with a single-walled CNT using classical molecular dynamic simulations. We firstly observe that the thermal conductivity (k) of C3NNT is lower than that of CNT. Due to the phonon scattering in the N atoms of C3NNT, the energy is localized around the N atoms. Monotonic decreasing trends of k with increasing temperature are shown in CNT and C3NNT, indicating strong Umklapp phonon scattering. Afterwards, uniaxial strains from -10\% to 14\% are applied to the nanotubes, and the thermal conductivity initially increases and then decreases. Phonon density of states, phonon dispersions, participation ratios, and spatial distribution of energy are used to analyze the phonon behaviors in nanotubes. This work provides fundamental thermo-physical knowledge to the thermal management of CNT and C3NNT based nanoelectronics.},

The effect that a substrate's surface has on the deposition and growth of CaCO3 crystals in terms of its physical and chemical parameters is explored. In addition, substrate effects on crystal morphology are examined as the nature of the substrate is clearly shown to influence the prominent polymorph in CaCO3 deposition. Also, the adhesion of CaCO3 to a surface is affected by the mechanism of deposition and this is assessed by whether crystals migrated from the bulk solution to settle on the surface or heterogeneously nucleate on the surface itself and subsequently grow there. The work provides evidence that the surfaces are acting as nucleation sites for crystals to heterogeneously initiate and grow and is also a demonstration of crystals growing in confinement.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is a continuous process whereby a hot aqueous feed provides the latent heat to vaporize water that diffuses through a hydrophobic microporous membrane and condenses. MD is attractive for saline and wastewater treatment as well as concentrating heat-sensitive solutions such as fruit juices and biological fluids since it operates at moderate temperatures and atmospheric pressure, rejects particulates and nonvolatile solutes, uses non-selective membranes, and has low capital costs. However, MD and MD bioreactor (MDBR) performance is compromised by fouling. The effect of fouling layers with reasonably large pores ({$>$}50nm) is reasonably well-understood and has been incorporated into MD models. However, the effect of fouling layers with very small pores or free volume ({$<$}50nm) owing to macromolecular- and bio-fouling (MMBF) is not well-understood. While MMBF introduces an additional resistance to heat transfer, it can also reduce the vapor-pressure driving force. This latter effect is unique to MD fouled by MMBF. In this analysis the vapor pressure reduction has been incorporated into a model that indicates the large flux declines observed in prior studies can be explained by the vapor-pressure reduction associated with pore diameters ranging from 3.9 to 8.5nm, which agree well with evapoporometry characterization of MMBF sludges. The predicted flux decline and temperature polarization coefficient indicate that the vapor-pressure reduction increases markedly for effective pore diameters less than 10nm, but can be mitigated by increasing the thermal resistance of the membrane and by fabricating a dual-layer membrane for which the feed side is hydrophilic with relatively large pores.},

The applications of VMD can be grouped into three major processes: the single component transport process, the binary component transport process and the multicomponent transport process. The porous and hydrophobic membrane in the VMD system serves as a physical support for the liquid-gas interface and does not allow one of the phases to disperse into the other. The membrane provides an efficient separator for the phase-change process. The use of the correct membrane can offer a high production rate and a high separation factor at low temperatures. VMD, an alternative separation technology with applications in desalination, concentration, organic extraction and dissolved gas removal, can compete with conventional liquid-gas separation systems. The present paper critically reviewed VMD technology; the important components of the scope of this review included applications and processes, membrane modules, heat and mass transfer, model development, membrane, process conditions, fouling, energy consumption and production cost. Finally, the potential for future research as a requisite for VMD industrialisation was suggested. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Exploiting the good water affinity of graphene oxide, the filler can be easily dispersed in oligomers formulations and printed by using a low cost DLP equipment. Then the UV post curing process, which is always mandatory after a DLP process, is exploited to in situ reduce the graphene oxide embedded in the matrix; similarly a thermal treatment is also investigated as post process. Different 3D structures are submitted to the reduction post-treatments and the influence of the UV and thermal reduction on the mechanical and electrical properties of the printed objects is investigated. The present work shows the possibility to easily produce 3D shaped GO-based composites whose final properties can be tailored trough a UV or thermal post process performed on the printed parts that induces the in situ reduction of GO embedded in the polymer matrix.},

  abstract = {Surging growth of aquaculture industry has alarmed the public when the wastewater discharged had an adverse effect on the environment. This current study is a pioneer in the use of membrane distillation (MD) to treat real aquaculture wastewater. In addition to excellent hydrophobicity, the slippery surface of membrane used for MD is another key factor that enhances the performance of MD. The slippery surface of the membrane was tuned by layering high-viscosity and low-viscosity polypropylene (PP) polymers on the electrospun membrane by solvent-exchanged method. While the high-viscosity PP coating (PP/HV) rendered the membrane surface slippery, the low-viscosity PP coating (PP/LV) caused the fish farm wastewater to have stick-slip movement on the membrane surface. In the long-term 70-hour direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) separation, PP/HV and PP/LV membranes can perfectly eliminate the undesirable components in the fish farm wastewater. The PP/HV membrane has registered a flux of 19.1 kg/m2{$\cdot$}h, while the flux of PP/LV membrane was only 7.3 kg/m2{$\cdot$}h. The PP/HV membrane also showed excellent anti-scaling properties in relative to the PP/LV membrane. This is because the PP/HV membrane promotes effortless gliding of the feed water along the surface of the membrane, while the surface of the PP/LV membrane has a static water boundary. Therefore, it can be concluded that the application of MD using the membrane coated with high-viscosity PP polymer is a feasible technology for the treatment of aquaculture wastewater.},

  abstract = {Physical water treatment (PWT) is an attempt to treat hard water for the purpose of preventing or mitigating fouling using a physical means, without adding chemicals to water. PWT technology prevents or mitigates scale build-up at heat exchangers. The fouling problem starts because of hard water being heated inside heat transfer equipment. The precipitation of dissolved mineral ions and subsequent scale deposit on the heat transfer surface critically depend on water chemistry. In addition to water chemistry, the deposit and removal rates of scale also depend on flow velocity, heat flux, and heat exchanger geometry. The central hypothesis of PWT is bulk precipitation. This chapter focuses on the science behind bulk precipitation, which leads to particulate fouling that produces a soft sludge coating on the heat transfer surface. Thus, for the successful operation of PWT, the ability to remove the soft sludge coating is essential. The various mechanisms of physical water treatment--such as effect of electric and magnetic fields, separation of charges, PWT works at surface via heterogeneous catalysis, and bulk precipitation--along with effect of particles in water on fouling mitigation have been discussed. The chapter also describes the validation methods for the efficiency of PWT and issues involved in the validation of PWT. It is essential to identify the conditions where PWT does and does not work, which in turn helps to understand the fundamental mechanism of PWT. The effectiveness of PWT at laboratory tests, in general, depends on the test conditions, including the flow velocity through permanent magnets, water hardness, and recirculation.},

MDC combines two individual processes, specifically membrane distillation and crystallization to facilitate the extraction of clean water and separation of high purity salt contents from a brine solution. The potential of MDC for treating challenging hypersaline solutions has been suggested in numerous proof-of-concept studies and some lab-scale demonstration. Nonetheless, there still remain technical challenges which need to be studied before MDC can be economically implemented in practice. This review documents the basic concept of MDC and opportunities to strategically deploy this emerging technology platform for brine mining and zero liquid discharge (ZLD). This paper also discusses key technical challenges (including scaling prevention and membrane wetting which need to be addressed for successful field application) hindering the practical realization of MDC for full-scale operation as well as pathways to address these challenges. Different crystallization techniques such as reaction crystallization and drowning-out crystallization are covered here in order to offer suggestions on their suitability for MDC operation.},

Solubility products and rate constants were determined from thermodynamic and kinetic studies and the results indicated that even minute amounts of calcium sulfate affect the thermodynamics, kinetics and the scale structure and no longer the solubility data and rate constants for the pure salt were applicable. Presence of CaSO4 from 0.002 to 0.01M increased the calcium carbonate solubility product more than an order of magnitude. The effect of salt mixture on the solubility constant of non-dominant salt (calcium sulfate) was reverse as calcium sulfate solubility increased to its pure value with increases in its molar ratio. In addition, the rate equation suggested in the literature (J. Colloid Interface Sci. 37 (1971) 824; J. Colloid Interface Sci. 36 (1971) 166) for pure salt was not applicable to the experimental data. The general observations indicated that the presence of CaSO4 had weakened the CaCO3 scale which is usually very adherent.

  abstract = {Fouling and wetting of membranes are significant concerns that can impede the widespread application of the membrane distillation (MD) process during high-salinity wastewater reclamation. Fouling, caused by the accumulation of undesirable materials on the membrane surface and pores, causes a decrease in permeate flux. Membrane wetting, the direct permeation of the feed solution through the membrane pores, results in reduced contaminant rejection and overall process failure. Lately, the application of MD for water recovery from various types of wastewaters has gained increased attention among researchers. In this review, we discuss fouling and wetting phenomena observed during the MD process, along with the effects of various mitigation strategies. In addition, we examine the interactions between contaminants and different types of MD membranes and the influence of different operating conditions on the occurrence of fouling and wetting. We also report on previously investigated feed pre-treatment options before MD, application of integrated MD processes, the performance of fabricated/modified MD membranes, and strategies for MD membrane maintenance during water reclamation. Energy consumption and economic aspects of MD for wastewater recovery is also discussed. Throughout the review, we engage in dialogues highlighting research needs for furthering the development of MD: the incorporation of MD in the overall wastewater treatment and recovery scheme (including selection of appropriate membrane material, suitable pre-treatment or integrated processes, and membrane maintenance strategies) and the application of MD in long-term pilot-scale studies using real wastewater.

  abstract = {Mineral scaling constrains membrane distillation (MD) and limits its application in treating hypersaline wastewater. Addressing this challenge requires enhanced fundamental understanding of the scaling phenomenon. However, MD scaling with different types of scalants may have distinctive mechanisms and consequences which have not been systematically investigated in the literature. In this work, we compared gypsum and silica scaling in MD and demonstrated that gypsum scaling caused earlier water flux decline and induced membrane wetting that was not observed in silica scaling. Microscopic imaging and elemental mapping revealed contrasting scale morphology and distribution for gypsum and silica, respectively. Notably, while gypsum crystals grew both on the membrane surface and deep in the membrane matrix, silica only formed on the membrane surface in the form of a relatively thin film composed of connected submicrometer silica particles. We attribute the intrusion of gypsum into membrane pores to the crystallization pressure as a result of rapid, oriented crystal growth, which leads to pore deformation and the subsequent membrane wetting. In contrast, the silica scale layer was formed via polymerization of silicic acid and gelation of silica particles, which were less intrusive and had a milder effect on membrane pore structure. This hypothesis was supported by the result of tensile testing, which showed that the MD membrane was significantly weakened by gypsum scaling. The fact that different scaling mechanisms could yield different consequences on membrane performance provides valuable insights for the future development of cost-effective strategies for scaling control.},

The effect of different duration of plasma treatment on the nanofiber membrane characteristics was investigated. The AGMD performance of the membranes was evaluated using real reverse osmosis (RO) brine produced from coal seam gas (CSG) water that was added with low surface tension liquid (surfactant) as feed solution. Results indicated the formation of new CF2-CF2 and CF3 bonds after plasma treatment, which lowered the surface energy of the membrane, providing omniphobic property, as indicated by its wetting resistance to different low surface tension liquids such as methanol, mineral oil and ethylene glycol. Though no appreciative changes in morphology of the membrane were observed after plasma treatment, optimal treatment condition of 15min (i.e., P/CF-15 membrane) exhibited lotus effect membrane surface with increased liquid entry pressure of 187 kPa compared to 142 kPa for neat membrane. AGMD performance showed stable normalized flux (initial flux of 15.3L/m2h) and rejection ratio (100\%) for P/CF-15 even with the addition of up to 0.7mM sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant to the RO brine from CSG produced water feed, while commercial PVDF membrane suffered membrane wetting after 0.3mM of surfactant addition. Based on the results, the present omniphobic membrane has good potential for producing clean water from challenging waters containing high salinity and organic contaminants.},

Using classical molecular dynamics, we report the desalination performance of such membranes as a function of pore size, chemical functionalization, and applied pressure. Our results indicate that the membrane's ability to prevent the salt passage depends critically on pore diameter with adequately sized pores allowing for water flow while blocking ions. Further, an investigation into the role of chemical functional groups bonded to the edges of graphene pores suggests that commonly occurring hydroxyl groups can roughly double the water flux thanks to their hydrophilic character. The increase in water flux comes at the expense of less consistent salt rejection performance, which we attribute to the ability of hydroxyl functional groups to substitute for water molecules in the hydration shell of the ions. Overall, our results indicate that the water permeability of this material is several orders of magnitude higher than conventional reverse osmosis membranes, and that nanoporous graphene may have a valuable role to play for water purification.},

  abstract = {It has been proposed that the air-cooled configuration for air gap membrane distillation is an effective way to simplify the system design and energy source requirement. This offers potential for the practical applications of membrane distillation on an industrial scale. In this work, membrane distillation tests were performed using a typical water-cooled membrane distillation (WCMD) configuration and an air-cooled membrane distillation (ACMD) configuration with various condensing plates and operating conditions. To increase the permeate flux of an ACMD system, the condensing plate in the permeate side should transfer heat to the atmosphere more effectively, such as using a more thermally conductive plate, adding fins, or introducing forced convection air flow. Importantly, a practical mass transfer model was proposed to describe the ACMD performance in terms of permeate flux. This model can be simplified by introducing specific correction values to the mass transfer coefficient of a WCMD process under the same conditions. The two factors relate to the capacity (B) and the efficiency ({$\sigma$}), which can be considered as the characteristic factors of a membrane distillation (MD) system. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical estimations based on this model, which can be used to describe the performance of an MD process.},

  abstract = {Porous amorphous catalysts often have a fractal internal surface down to molecular scales. The movement of gas molecules inside the narrow channels that constitute all or most of the pore space, is mainly hindered by collisions with the surface, rather than with each other: Knudsen diffusion, rather than bulk molecular diffusion is then the main diffusion mechanism. The influence of the fractal surface morphology on the Knudsen diffusivity is investigated. A momentum transfer technique leads to a smooth field approximation for the Knudsen diffusivity. The dependence of the surface accessibility on the size of the molecules causes the Knudsen diffusivity of a molecule to depend on its effective diameter. Because the previous method assumes a uniform surface accessibility, a first-passage time technique is developed, which accounts for the true accessibility distribution over the surface. The problem is solved analytically and the result is a simple expression of the Knudsen diffusivity. Extensions of this technique to other problems in catalysis and to other fields are discussed. Once a property, like the Knudsen diffusivity, is known for a medium with smooth walls, the method developed here allows us to calculate the same property for a medium with fractal walls.},

This entails matching functional pulsed plasma polymer nanolayers with appropriate slippery lubricants. A molecular-level structure-behavior relationship is developed, highlighting the importance of favorable aromatic-aliphatic intermolecular interactions between the coating and lubricant. Fluorinated lubricant-infused pulsed plasma polymer nanocoatings resist wetting by liquids, spanning a wide range of surface tensions (including pentane, motor oil, and water, i.e., omniphobicity). In the case of natural antimicrobial compound-infused functional plasma polymer surfaces (e.g., the essential oil cinnamaldehyde), multifunctional performance is attained combining high liquid repellency (self-cleaning) with simultaneous strong antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (log(10) reduction {$>$} 7). In addition, these lubricant-infused functional pulsed plasma polymer surfaces easily repel a variety of everyday liquids (including foodstuffs such as tomato ketchup and honey).},

For flat menisci that have depinned from the top of the grating and have displaced downwards into the cavities, the axial velocity is determined analytically and the slip length extracted from it. This solution is then combined with an integral identity to determine the first-order correction to the slip length when the displaced menisci bow weakly into the cavity. It is argued that the new formulas provide useful upper bounds for quantifying slip in microchannel flows involving partially filled cavities. The new solutions are natural extensions of prior results due to Philip (Z. Angew. Math.

Aerogel has specific acoustic properties and remarkably lower thermal conductivity (approximate to 0.013 W/m K) than the other commercial insulating materials. It also has superior physical and chemical characteristics like the translucent structure. Therefore, it is considered as one of the most promising thermal insulating materials for building applications. Besides its applications in residential and industrial buildings, aerogel has a great deal of application areas such as spacecrafts, skyscrapers, automobiles, electronic devices, clothing etc. Although current cost of aerogel still remains higher compared to the conventional insulation materials, intensive efforts are made to reduce its manufacturing cost and hence enable it to become widespread all over the world. In this study, a comprehensive review on aerogel and its utilization in buildings are presented. Thermal insulation materials based on aerogel are illustrated with various applications. Economic analysis and future potential of aerogel are also considered in the study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.},

  abstract = {Unexpected mineral surface fouling, or deposition, is a ubiquitously recurring problem in many industrial and municipal processes (e.g., membrane filtration, oil and gas production). Accurate predictions of mineral deposition and inhibition kinetics are critical for mineral deposition control. Unfortunately, no reliable mineral deposition model is available, potentially due to insufficient knowledge of thermodynamics, crystallization and deposition kinetics, and inhibition kinetics under complex operational conditions. This study developed a new mineral surface deposition and inhibition (MSDI) platform to overcome these challenges. Specifically, the MSDI platform integrates a Pitzer theory-based thermodynamic model that can predict mineral saturation levels up to 250 {\textopenbullet}C, 1500 bars, and 6 mol/kg H2O ionic strength. It simulates mineral deposition in two phases. In Phase 1, the first deposition layer forms in the stagnant laminar sublayer following batch crystallization and inhibition kinetics; in Phase 2, the deposition rate is simulated using flow dynamic models, and the inhibitor impacts are modelled by a Langmuir-type kink site adsorption isotherm. This MSDI platform has been validated by laboratory laminar-to-turbulent flow experiments and field observations. As one of the few mineral deposition prediction tools, the MSDI platform has solid theoretical foundation with great accuracy over wide ranges of applicable conditions.},

However, due to the lack of a microstructure to control pores, graphene aerogels have poor mechanical properties, poor adsorption properties and low practicality. Here, we have developed a base-induced method for easily obtaining highly ordered graphene aerogels (HOGAs) with excellent properties. The HOGA demonstrates a high compressive strength of 32 kPa under the strain of 70\%. What's more, after a huge compressive strain of 95\% repeated 10 times, the maximum stress and height remain unchanged. Owing to the ultra-high elasticity, excellent mechanical properties and stable force-electrical conversion characteristics, the HOGA is used to prepare a stress/strain sensor, which can substitute for sensing human movement and distinguish different walking postures. In addition, the HOGA possesses an ultra-fast adsorption rate (83 g g               -1               s               -1               ) for organic solvents making it an ideal candidate for environmental remediation.},

  abstract = {Within the lifetime of most membranes some fouling will adversely affect membrane performance and cleaning will be necessary. The cleaning will depend on the type of deposit such as organic fouling, inorganic scaling or colloidal deposition. However strong the circumstantial evidence as to the identity of the foulant, the only reliable method of determining the true identity of the foulant with confidence, is by membrane autopsy. Different deposits affect the performance of the plant in different ways. Deposits such as organic fouling cause reduced output and increased differential pressure along the membranes and often require higher operating pressure to maintain output. Inorganic deposits can be a cause of irreversibly increase in salt passage. All forms of membrane fouling cause a significant increase in plant downtime and maintenance costs. Following an extensive study of membrane fouling during the autopsy procedure, we can usually recommend a protocol for the most suitable cleaning procedure. Cleaning procedures can be supported by proposals for antiscalant treatments to avoid the formation of deposits and in some cases retard membrane fouling. It is common to find deterioration in the salt rejection layer leading to a significant increase in salt passage. In some cases this is associated with an increase in product flow and may be caused by oxidation of the membrane, deposition of inorganic salts, abrasion or even the tearing of the membrane leaves themselves. If the cause of the fouling can be identified, recurrence of the problem can often be prevented, although in some cases, salt rejection performance maybe irrecoverable. This paper considers the results of some autopsies from plants with different problems and presents a general opinion of current operating practice. Photographic evidence is included showing some of the different forms of scale and fouling. Conclusions are given based on the general experiences of the staff carrying out these autopsies.},

Crystals larger than the Kolmogoroff microscale collide because of the fluctuating velocity field. Bridges between the crystals form as a result of competition between crystalline growth and the turbulent velocity fluctuations on the opposite sides of the agglomerate.             Crystals smaller than the Kolmogoroff microscale collide because of viscous laminar microshear stresses within the same turbulent eddy, are kept close together by Van der Waals forces and are joined together by crystalline bridges that grow between them. The strength of these bridges depends on the supersaturation level during the moments following the collision.             These two sets of phenomena lead to two different preferential generation mechanisms for agglomerates. One example involving important agglomeration effects is developed for each case: the crystallization of adipic acid belongs to the first group (large crystals), whereas the precipitation of calcium oxalate monohydrate is typical of the second case (small crystals).},

  abstract = {We develop the embedded-atom method [Phys. Rev. Lett. 50, 1285 (1983)], based on density-functional theory, as a new means of calculating ground-state properties of realistic metal systems. We derive an expression for the total energy of a metal using the embedding energy from which we obtain several ground-state properties, such as the lattice constant, elastic constants, sublimation energy, and vacancy-formation energy. We obtain the embedding energy and accompanying pair potentials semiempirically for Ni and Pd, and use these to treat several problems: surface energy and relaxation of the (100), (110), and (111) faces; properties of H in bulk metal (H migration, binding of H to vacancies, and lattice expansion in the hydride phase); binding site and adsorption energy of hydrogen on (100), (110), and (111) surfaces; and lastly, fracture of Ni and the effects of hydrogen on the fracture. We emphasize problems with hydrogen and with surfaces because none of these can be treated with pair potentials. The agreement with experiment, the applicability to practical problems, and the simplicity of the technique make it an effective tool for atomistic studies of defects in metals.},

  abstract = {The embedded-atom method is a semi-empirical method for performing calculations of defects in metals. The EAM incorporates a picture of metallic bonding, for which there is some fundamental basis. The limitations of the EAM are fairly well characterized: it works best for purely metallic systems with no directional bonding; it does not treat covalency or significant charge transfer; and it does not handle Fermi-surface effects. The main physical property incorporated in the EAM is the moderation of bond strength by other bonds (coordination-dependent bond strength). Within these constraints, the EAM provides a very useful and robust means of calculating approximate structure and energetics, from which many interesting properties of metals can be obtained. We believe that atomistic calculations will continue to play an important role in the development of materials theory. Where the EAM can be useful, there is a tremendous number of interesting projects that have yet to be carried out. The understanding of mechanical properties on an atomistic level has only just begun. For materials where the EAM is not expected to work well, there are recent developments which may allow calculations similar to those presented here. We have mentioned already the problem of treating directional bonding in semiconductors and elements from the transition series. One approach which promises to be useful for treating directional bonding is reviewed by Carlsson [70]; the interested reader is encouraged to start there.},

The purpose of this paper is to examine from both a historical and philosophical perspective one such boundary condition, namely, the no-slip condition of fluid dynamics. The historical perspective is based on the works of George Stokes and serves as the foundation for the philosophical perspective. It is seen that historically the acceptance of the no-slip condition was problematic. Philosophically, the no-slip condition is interesting since the use of the no-slip condition illustrates nicely the use of scientific models. But more importantly, both the use and justification of the no-slip condition illustrate clearly how theories can holistically approach the world through model construction. Further, since much of the debate over scientific realism occurs in the realm of models, a case is made that an understanding of the role of the no-slip condition has something to offer to this debate.},

However, MD technology still faces limitations mainly due to low permeate flux and membrane wetting for feeds containing low surface tension compounds. Perfluorinated superhydrophobic membranes could be an alternative, but it has negative environmental impacts. Therefore, other low surface energy materials such as silica aerogel and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) have great relevancy in ENMs fabrication. Herein, we have reported the high flux and nonwettability of ENMs fabricated by electrospraying aerogel/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) over electrospinning polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) membrane (E-PH). Among various concentrations of aerogel, the 30\% aerogel (E-M3-A30) dual layer membrane achieved highest superhydrophobicity (similar to 170 degrees water contact angle), liquid entry pressure (LEP) of 129.5 +/- 3.4 kPa, short water droplet bouncing performance (11.6 ms), low surface energy (4.18 +/- 0.27 mN m(-1)) and high surface roughness (R-a: 5.04 mu m) with re-entrant structure. It also demonstrated nonwetting MD performance over a continuous 7 days operation of saline water (3.5\% of NaCl), high antiwetting with harsh saline water containing 0.5 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 28.9 mN m(-1)), synthetic algal organic matter (AOM).},

  abstract = {The overwhelming basicity of all analysed surfaces strongly dependent on the choice of liquid triplet used for contact angle measurements and the negative values sometimes obtained for the square roots of the acid-- base parameters can be summarized as the main problems arising from the application of the Good-- van Oss-- Chaudhury (GvOC) theory to the calculation of Lewis acid-- base properties of polymer surfaces from contact angle data. This paper tries to account for these problems, namely: (1) the Lewis base, or electron donor component, is much greater than the Lewis acid or electron-acceptor component because of the reference values for water chosen in the original GvOC theory. A direct comparison of the acidic component with the basic one of the same materials has no meaning. A new reference scale for water which is able to overcome this problem is suggested. For the calculation of acid-- base components, a best- t approach is proposed which does not require any starting information about the liquids or polymers and can yield estimates of the acid-- base parameters for both the liquids and the polymers involved; (2) the strong dependence of the value of the acid-- base components on the three liquids employed is due to ill-conditioning of the related set of equations, an intrinsic and purely mathematical feature which cannot be completely cured by any realistic improvement in experimental accuracy. To reduce or eliminate the effect, one only needs a proper set of liquids, representative of all kinds of different solvents; (3) the negative coef cients appear as a simple consequence of measurement uncertainty, combined with the possible ill-conditioning of the equation set. We cannot exclude, however, that in some cases they could have a different origin.},

In the past year, two independent studies (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 51, 7041; CrystEngComm, 14, 44) have proposed new, yet different models on the basis of electron diffraction experiments and ab initio calculations, respectively. Here, it is shown that there are at least three effectively isoenergetic models that are equally likely to describe the vaterite structure at room temperature. These distinct models, each consisting of multiple structures, can explain the disorder of vaterite in terms of different orientations of the carbonate anions, multiple stacking sequences of the carbonate layers, and possible chiral forms. Hence, vaterite is not a single ``disordered'' structure but should instead be considered as a combination of different forms, each of which can exhibit rapid interchange between multiple structures that exhibit similar average properties.},

Through biomineralization, organisms can harness and control this process to form various functional materials that can act as anything from shells through to lenses. The early stages of calcium carbonate formation have recently attracted attention as stable prenucleation clusters have been observed, contrary to classical models. Here we show, using computer simulations combined with the analysis of experimental data, that these mineral clusters are made of an ionic polymer, composed of alternating calcium and carbonate ions, with a dynamic topology consisting of chains, branches and rings. The existence of a disordered, flexible and strongly hydrated precursor provides a basis for explaining the formation of other liquid-like amorphous states of calcium carbonate, in addition to the non-classical behaviour during growth of amorphous calcium carbonate.},

The morphologies of polymerized fluorododecyltrichlorosilane (PFTCS) coated PVDF nanofibers evolved from the newly budding willow twigs with tiny bumps, to vigorous buds and then to intertwined fillets with the increase of FTCS concentration, which could serve as a robust barrier to low-surface-tension liquid penetration. By constructing hierarchically re-entrant structures of low-surface-energy PFTCS coating layer onto the PVDF nanofibers, the resultant porous ENMs were endowed with omniphobic property, low water-adhesion property, remarkable mechanical property, and superior durability in harsh circumstances as well as good breathability. The comprehensive investigations on structural attributes (such as the liquid entry pressure, pore size, porosity and gas permeability), long-term MD stability and DCMD performance in presence of surfactants were carried out. Significantly, the resultant omniphobic PFTCS/PVDF membrane exhibited a competitive permeate vapor flux of 36.9\,kg/(m2\,h) in highly salty solution (3.5\,wt\% NaCl salt feed; {$\Delta$}T\,=\,40\,{$^\circ$}C) over 24\,h operation and also demonstrated robust DCMD performance in presence of surfactants. Compared with the commercial PVDF MD membranes, this simple and scalable strategy had great potential for MD applications.},

Nevertheless, such hydrophobic thin films rely only on graphene non-polar surface, rather than taking advantage of its surface roughness. Furthermore, graphene is typically not self-standing. Differently, carbon aerogels have high porosity, large effective surface area due to their surface roughness, and very low mass density, which make them a promising candidate as a super-hydrophobic material for novel technological applications. However, despite a few works reporting the general super-hydrophobic and lipophilic behavior of the carbon aerogels, a detailed characterization of their wetting properties is still missing, to date. Here, the wetting properties of graphene aerogels are demonstrated in detail. Without any chemical functionalization or patterning of their surface, the samples exhibit a super-lipophilic state and a stationary super-hydrophobic state with a contact angle up to               150               ~{\textpm}~               15               {$^\circ$} and low contact angle hysteresis ~{$\approx~$}               15               {$^\circ$}, owing to the fakir effect.

Membrane distillation (MD) is a desalination technology attractive for its adequacy to use low-grade waste heat or renewable energy sources. This work addresses the modelling of a Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD) plant with heat recovery. The desalination unit comprises several DCMD modules, each of a shell and hollow fibre tube bundle type. A multiscale approach is needed to address the problem. It includes modelling of the vapour flux through the micro/nano porous membrane, models for the mass and energy conservation at the scale of a single DCMD module, and thermodynamic modelling at the scale of the desalination plant. Analytical solutions of the mass and heat transfer across the membranes are combined with finite volume discretised equations describing heat and mass conservation for the feed and permeate streams. An iterative scheme is devised to solve the model equations in order to determine the flow and temperature variables in the DCMD module. The computational model predictions show good agreement with experimental data available in the literature. Finally, the methodology presented herein is used to simulate the performance of a DCMD desalination plant with heat recovery.},

  abstract = {This critical review investigates the potential for membrane distillation to desalinate high-salinity waters using low-grade heat at the water-energy nexus.           ,              Energy-efficient desalination and water treatment technologies play a critical role in augmenting freshwater resources without placing an excessive strain on limited energy supplies. By desalinating high-salinity waters using low-grade or waste heat, membrane distillation (MD) has the potential to increase sustainable water production, a key facet of the water-energy nexus. However, despite advances in membrane technology and the development of novel process configurations, the viability of MD as an energy-efficient desalination process remains uncertain. In this review, we examine the key challenges facing MD and explore the opportunities for improving MD membranes and system design. We begin by exploring how the energy efficiency of MD is limited by the thermal separation of water and dissolved solutes. We then assess the performance of MD relative to other desalination processes, including reverse osmosis and multi-effect distillation, comparing various metrics including energy efficiency, energy quality, and susceptibility to fouling. By analyzing the impact of membrane properties on the energy efficiency of an MD desalination system, we demonstrate the importance of maximizing porosity and optimizing thickness to minimize energy consumption. We also show how ineffective heat recovery and temperature polarization can limit the energetic performance of MD and how novel process variants seek to reduce these inefficiencies. Fouling, scaling, and wetting can have a significant detrimental impact on MD performance. We outline how novel membrane designs with special surface wettability and process-based fouling control strategies may bolster membrane and process robustness. Finally, we explore applications where MD may be able to outperform established desalination technologies, increasing water production without consuming large amounts of electrical or high-grade thermal energy. We conclude by discussing the outlook for MD desalination, highlighting challenges and key areas for future research and development.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, in dry and rural areas, solar-powered membrane distillation (SPMD) technology is considered a feasiblemeans for the production of pure water from brackish water. Prior to the design and construction of a SPMD pilot plant, there is a need to predict its performance theoretically by means of a computational simulation program. Unlike previous approaches followed by other investigators to develop a mathematical model that can describe the components of a SPMD pilot plant, the developed mathematical model in this study is based on the fact that the SPMD process by nature is unsteady. The performance of a proposed SPMD pilot plant is then obtained by means of a numerical solution of the model with the aid of a simulation computer program. The results reveal that the proposed SPMD pilot plant has some unique features, which differ from a similar MD process operated at steady-state conditions in a laboratory. The analysis of the system has shown that heat recovery via an external heat exchanger is not only possible, but even effective, and an economical way to intensify the SPMD process. The plant productivity can be improved by increasing the heat-exchanger capacity (KA), decreasing the flow rates of both feed and permeate or otherwise by increasing the effective surface area of the membrane. The achieved enhancements in the SPMD pilot plant productivity are directly related to an improved heat recovery rate in the heat exchanger. However, further analysis reported in this paper shows that the increase in KA and membrane area should be optimized for any planned capacity in the design of a SPMD pilot plant.},

Assembling of hollow or porous particles with the diameter larger than 100nm into hierarchically porous aerogels is efficient but challenging for achieving a high specific surface of aerogel. In this regard, submicron-sized carbon spheres with hollow cores and microporous shells are assembled into bulk aerogels, for the first time, in the presence of two-dimensional graphene sheets as special cross-linkers. The resulting bead-to-sheet polylithic aerogels show ultra-low density (51--67mgcm-3), high conductivity (263--695Sm-1) and high specific surface area (569--609m2g-1). An application of thermocells is demonstrated with maximum output power of 1.05Wm-2 and maximum energy conversion efficiency of 1.4\% relative to Carnot engine, outperforming the current simple U-shaped thermocells reported elsewhere.},

However, with the proceeding of solar desalination, salt crystallization on the surface of solar evaporators caused by increasing salinity of seawater will result in a decrease in the evaporation rate. Thus, it is still challenging to fabricate solar evaporators with superior salt resistance. In this work, elastic ceramic-based nanofibrous aerogels with a cellular architecture are fabricated by the combination of electrospinning and fiber freeze-shaping technologies, which are composed of vertically aligned vessels and porous vessel walls. Under the action of convection and diffusion promoted by this unique cellular architecture, the aerogels exhibit a superior salt-resistance without any salt crystals on the surface of aerogels even in 20\% brine and under 6-sun irradiation. Moreover, by virtue of the synergistic effect of the promising structure and light absorbance of carbon nanotubes, aerogels possess a high light absorbance of up to 98\% and excellent evaporation performance achieving 1.50 kg m               -2               h               -1               under 1-sun irradiation.

  abstract = {Sufficient and clean freshwater is still out of reach for billions of people around the world. Solar desalination from brine is regarded as one of the most promising proposals to solve this severe crisis. However, most of the reported evaporators to date still suffer from the decreasing evaporation rate caused by salt crystallization accumulated on their surface. Here, inspired by the vascular tissue structure, transpiration, and antifouling function of reed leaves, we design biomimetic hierarchical nanofibrous aerogels with parallel-arranged vessels and hydrophobic surfaces for highly efficient and salt-resistant solar desalination. Foldable vessel walls and flexible silica nanofibers give the reed leaf-inspired nanofiber aerogels (RNFAs) excellent mechanical properties and enable them to withstand repeated compression. Besides, the R-NFAs can efficiently absorb sunlight (light absorption efficiency: 94.8\%) and evaporate the brine to vapor, similar to reed leaves (evaporation rate: 1.25 kg m-2 h-1 under 1 sun). More importantly, enabled by the hydrophobic surfaces and parallel-arranged vessels, the R-NFAs can work stably in high-concentration brine (saturated, 26.3 wt \%) under high-intensity light (up to 6 sun), demonstrating potent salt resistance. It is expected that RNFAs with combined antisalt pore and surface structures will provide a designed concept for salt-resistant solar desalination.},

The removal of spilled oil from water resources is still a very topical issue. An eco-friendly and sustainable approach towards the environment has introduced many low-cost, non-toxic and biodegradable materials along with different biomasses to make micro-to nano-sized materials, membranes, sponges/aerogel, etc. for the removal and recovery of oil from water resources. Additionally, the reusability of these materials after the recovery of oils has added one more step towards sustainability.

  abstract = {Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) contamination in drinking water resources remains a challenge in many parts of the United States, as well as in regions affected by industrial pollution. In this study, we demonstrated how electrically conducting carbon nanotube (CNT) -- polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite ultrafiltration (UF) membranes can be used to remove Cr(VI) from water through a combined process of electrostatic repulsion, electrochemical reduction, and precipitation. The impact of different operational (flux, contact time, applied electrical potential) and environmental (pH and salinity) conditions on Cr(VI) removal were evaluated. Due to the native electrical potential of the CNT/PVA UF membrane material, approximately 45\% removal of 1ppm Cr(VI) solution was detected under neutral pH conditions in deionized water. Increased Cr(VI) removal was observed with increasing membrane surface charge density, which was accomplished through the application of an external potential (3V, 5V and 7V, membrane as cathode) to the electrically conductive membrane surface. The solution ionic strength showed a significant impact on Cr(VI) removal. By increasing the ionic strength without applying external potential on the membrane, the electrostatic repulsive force between the charged membrane surface and the CrO42- ion was eliminated, and Cr(VI) removal dropped to zero. The highest removal (95\%) was achieved when 7V was applied to the membrane/counter electrode with a 6{\textmu}m-thick membrane. Here, Cr(VI) was electrochemically reduced to Cr(III) on the membrane surface, followed by Cr(III) precipitation as chromium hydroxide Cr(OH)3(s), which occurred by Cr(III) reacting with hydroxide ions generated via water splitting on the CNT network. Precipitated Cr(OH)3 was then removed by the UF membrane. In addition, CNT-PVA UF membranes were used to treat tap water spiked with Cr(VI); under these conditions, 99\% Cr(VI) removal was observed when 7V were applied to the membrane/counter electrode. Furthermore, we demonstrate that other trace inorganic contaminants, such as uranium, were effectively removed as well.},

In this work, we assess the impact of module design in bench-scale experiments, simplified treatment of heat transfer rates in MD models, and the effect of permeate flux on temperature polarization as sources of error in Nusselt correlation estimates of heat transfer rates. To test these effects, we systematically vary membrane structure, module sizes, temperatures, and Reynolds numbers to generate a large dataset (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 240) of MD experiments. We apply this dataset to estimate the heat transfer rate for each unique membrane/module combination and compare our predictions to the classical Sieder-Tate Nusselt correlation (Nus-t). Our results show that heat transfer rates in small modules can be up to five times higher than predicted by Nus-t. The heat transfer rate decreases with increasing module size, with heat transfer in large modules adequately described by the Sieder-Tate correlation. We demonstrate that this high heat transfer rate in small modules is a result of an entrance effect, which increases fluid mixing over the membrane area. These results validate the use of Nu correlation in large membrane modules while highlighting issues with their application in small scale systems. This work also emphasizes the importance of bench-scale module design in materials evaluation and process characterization. Finally, it highlights the need for direct measurement tech\- niques that better characterize interfacial processes in membrane systems with modeled driving forces.},

  abstract = {Membrane permeability and heat transfer rate in membrane distillation (MD) are approximated using physically incomplete empirical methods and imperfectly collected experimental data. This work develops a method for assessing the accuracy of these empirical methods as a function of the set of included parameters and the error in those parameter measurements. We train Neural Networks (NNs) on either process parameters (i.e. permeate flux, module design, temperatures, etc.) or both process parameters and membrane parameters (i.e., membrane porosity, membrane thermal conductivity, and pore size) from simulated MD datasets. We then compare NN predictions of membrane permeability, heat transfer rate, and membrane thermal conductivity to experimental data and a test set of simulated data with and without random error. NNs that use both process and membrane parameters have median errors, on average, 3 times lower than NNs using only process parameters and 20 times lower than Schofield and Modified-Schofield empirical methods. This work presents the first assessment of the accuracy of empirical methods for physical parameter estimation in MD and demonstrates the value of NNs in guiding the derivation of new empirical methods by identifying critical input parameters and the required measurement accuracy of those parameters.},

  abstract = {Self-supporting carbon nanotube (CNT) Bucky-Papers have unique structural and surface properties which can be utilised in many applications. In this work we characterised pure self-supporting CNT membranes, where CNTs were held together only by Van der Waals forces, and evaluated their potential and performance in direct contact membrane distillation. The membranes were found to be highly hydrophobic (contact angle of 113{\textopenbullet}), highly porous (90\%), and to exhibit a thermal conductivity of 2.7 kW/m2 h. We demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that self-supporting CNT Bucky-Paper membranes can be used for desalination in a direct contact membrane distillation setup with 99\% salt rejection and a flux rate of {$\sim$}12 kg/m2 h at a water vapour partial pressure difference of 22.7 kPa. Ageing of the membranes by delamination is a main factor limiting their performance and work is currently under way to address this issue by investigating composite material structures.},

  abstract = {Recent work showed that carbon nanotubes could be fabricated into bucky-paper structures as selfsupporting membranes and their hydrophobic property used for water desalination by membrane distillation. Carbon nanotube bucky-papers possess very interesting properties such as natural hydrophobicity, high porosity and very high specific surface area, making of them promising candidates for separation applications. However, to inhibit crack formation associated with poor mechanical stability, improved durability structures that retain a high degree of hydrophobicity need to be developed. In this work we chemically modified high purity carbon nanotubes by (i) UV/ozone treatment to create hydroxyl groups and (ii) reacting those groups by substitution with alkoxysilane based groups. The resulting nanotubes presented a silicon content up to 2.5\% and the bucky-papers produced had larger contact angle (140{\textopenbullet} compared to 125{\textopenbullet}) and liquid entry pressures. We report here on their fabrication and use as membranes in direct contact membrane distillation.},

  abstract = {We have developed the simultaneous membrane distillation--crystallization (SMDC) hybrid desalination technology for the concurrent productions of pure water and salt crystal from the saturated brine solutions. The effects of feed temperature variation from 40 1C to 70 1C on the SMDC performance in terms of membrane flux and kinetics of NaCl crystallization have been investigated. Increasing feed temperature increases membrane flux but the flux declines rapidly with time at higher feed temperatures (60 1C and 70 1C) due to the occurrences of membrane scaling and wetting facilitated by salt oversaturation at the boundary layer. In order to prevent salt oversaturation, we have calculated the critical fluxes at different Reynolds numbers and crystallizer temperatures. For instance, the critical fluxes when the feed temperature is 70 1C increase from 5 kg m-2 h-1 to 20 kg m-2 h-1 for the laminar and turbulent flows, respectively. By keeping the membrane flux lower than the critical flux, a stable membrane performance during a continuous SMDC operation over the period of 5000 min has been achieved. Increasing feed temperature also increases the yield of NaCl crystals from 7.5 kg per m3 solution to 34 kg per m3 for feed temperatures of 40 1C and 70 1C after 200 min operation, respectively. However, the average crystal sizes decrease from 87.40 mm to 48.82 mm with increasing feed temperatures from 40 1C to 70 1C due to a higher nucleation rate at a higher degree of supersaturation. Regardless of the feed temperature, the NaCl crystals are in a uniform cubical shape with the coefficient of variations which are in the range of 30--38\% that implies a narrow dispersion.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is an emerging technology for separations that are traditionally accomplished by conventional separation processes such as distillation or reverse osmosis. Since its appearance in the late of the 1960s and its development in the early of 1980s with the growth of membrane engineering, MD claims to be a cost effective separation process that can utilize low-grade waste and/or alternative energy sources such as solar and geothermal energy. As an attractive separation process, MD has been the subject of worldwide academic studies by many experimentalist and theoreticians. Unfortunately from the commercial stand point, MD has gained only little acceptance and yet to be implemented in industry. The major barriers include MD membrane and module design, membrane pore wetting, low permeate flow rate and flux decay as well as uncertain energetic and economic costs. This study is an attempt to establish a framework for better understanding the MD process and to consider all possible solutions developed so far to overcome its barriers. Unlike the usual trend pursued in review papers, MD studies have been cited in the present manuscript and classified in tables according to their most important contribution in MD development. These tables cover most important aspects of the MD process and are presented in a simple manner for a glance understanding the effects of different factors and operating variables on the productivity of each MD configuration. Among the different MD papers, those involving theoretical models are pointed out. The areas within the MD field that are either usually or rarely studied are highlighted. Some useful technical discussions based on acquired knowledge from experience and information gathered from MD literature are included. In some way, this paper will help new researchers in the field of MD to quickly be updated avoiding repetition of already known studies. In fact, although the effects of some operating parameters are generally agreed upon, still new researches appear with almost the same results.},

  abstract = {Capacitive deionization (CDI) has proven to be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly desalination process. However, the high salt adsorption capacity is hampered by the poor surface wettability of the electrode materials and a lack of charge in the surface electrode. Despite its unique chemical and physical properties, pure reduced graphene oxide is still far from the expected potential desalination performance. In this work, graphene aerogel (GA) and activated graphene aerogel (AGA) with an ultrahigh specific surface area were successfully synthesized. The AGA was functionalized using a charged polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) and utilized as a negative electrode for the asymmetric CDI configuration cell. The synthesized charged PSS-activated graphene aerogel (PSS-AGA) achieved outstanding hydrophilic behavior, a high specific surface area (1401.53 m2/g), and a typical specific capacitance of 178F/g, furthermore excellent capacitance retention of 97.2 \% over 5000 cycles. The salt adsorption capacity of the fabricated electrodes is evaluated by conducting a single-pass mode (SP-Mode) experiment under various conditions. The fabricated PSS-AGA//AGA asymmetric cell configuration delivers an exceptional salt adsorption capacity of 26.33 mg/g, excellent charge efficiency of 88 \% with low energy consumption at 1000 mg/L, and full regeneration with long-term stability.},

  abstract = {The two mechanisms accounting for alkaline scale formation inside MSF units are reviewed in short. Previous studies addressing the problem were primarily concerned with the mass or composition of the formed scales. As the nature of the scale depends on the composition of the brine out of which it separates, it is only reasonable to consider both phases simultaneously. Brine samples were extracted from the condensers, brine heater and flash chambers of two types of 18-stage, MSF units operating in the Umm Al Nar desalination plant (Abu Dhabi, UAE) over a period of 4 years. These were analyzed for Ca2+, Mg2+, CO-23, HCO-3, pH and the temperatures of the various cells recorded. During the cooling cycle of the brine, the first five parameters remained constant in cells (18-16) and (15-1). Between cells 16 and 15 the [Ca2+], [Mg2+], [CO2-3] and pH increased whereas the [HCOt-3] decreased. These changes are due to mixing of the concentrated brine with make-up water. This conclusion was confirmed by calculating the material balance of all ions. The fact that the product [Ca2+][CO2-3] of the brine is ca. 120--170 times larger than the solubility product of either aragonite or calcite, indicates delayed precipitation and excessive super-saturation with CaCO3. The analysis of brine samples extracted from the flash chambers revealed a continuous, linear build-up of [Ca2+ and [Mg2+] as one moves from cell 1 to cell 18. The pH value increased noticeably in the first 3--4 cells and remained constant thereafter. The [CO2-3] and [HCO-3] appeared to remain constant in all cells. The data were quantitatively treated by calculating cells' concentration factors and computing the expected amounts of the various ions in the different cells. Differences between these values and the experimentally determined quantities signified scaling. The results indicated the formation of Mg scales in cells 1--10 and of Ca scales in cells 1--16. The amounts of disappearing [CO2-3] exceeded that needed for CaCO3 deposition. The rest, together with the loss of [HCO2-3] were not enough to account for Mg(OH)2 precipitation. This latter was assumed to involve the participation of CaCO3 present in super-saturation. Scale samples were collected from some of the condenser tubes and the flash chambers of the distillers. These were fully analyzed for Ca2+, Mg2+, CO2-, OH-, Cl-, SO2-4, acid-insolubles, adsorbed humidity and organics. A scheme was proposed to relate the results of analyses to compounds of definite compositions with agreement better than {\textpm}3 \%. The results indicated that in one type of distillers (IHI) Ca-rich scales formed both in the condensers and flash chamber. In the second type of distillers (Italimpianti) the scales were predominantly Mg-rich. This disparity in behaviour does not signify two scaling mechanisms. It is suggested that the nature of scaling is decided by distiller top-temperature, volume, material, deaeration, and depends on type of anti-scalant additive and ball cleaning. Attention is drawn to the need of basic studies on the effect of additives and metallic surfaces on the rate of HCO-3 decomposition, as well as on the conditions governing super-saturation by CaCO3 and Mg(OH)2 and the kinetics and morphology of their crystallization.},

  abstract = {The local structure of liquid water as a function of temperature is a source of intense research. This structure is intimately linked to the dynamics of water molecules, which can be measured using Raman and infrared spectroscopies. The assignment of spectral peaks depends on whether they are collective modes or single-molecule motions. Vibrational modes in liquids are usually considered to be associated to the motions of single molecules or small clusters. Using molecular dynamics simulations, here we find dispersive optical phonon-like modes in the librational and OH-stretching bands. We argue that on subpicosecond time scales these modes propagate through water's hydrogen-bond network over distances of up to 2\,nm. In the long wavelength limit these optical modes exhibit longitudinal--transverse splitting, indicating the presence of coherent long-range dipole--dipole interactions, as in ice. Our results indicate the dynamics of liquid water have more similarities to ice than previously thought.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is an emerging thermal separation technique, using a hydrophobic microporous membrane. Initially, the process used MF membranes with a hydrophobic character, such as PTFE and PVDF membranes. These membranes are not wetted by aqueous feed liquids and their microporous structure allows the transport of water vapor molecules through the membrane due to an applied temperature difference. On average 23\% of the publications on MD focus on membrane engineering. Besides the traditional stretching and phase inversion technique, many novel techniques are proposed, including electrospinning, the use of carbon nanotubes, surface modification techniques and the design of novel polymers. This article provides guidelines for the evaluation of these membranes measured using a large variety in process conditions at lab scale. In the second part, an overview of the synthesis methods used for MD was given and the advantages, disadvantages and the performance of the respective membrane types in MD were evaluated.},

  abstract = {In this study, lithium ion (Li+) diffusion inside lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) as a cathode material is investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The effect of some important parameters such as voltage, Li+ content, and diffusion axis on Li+ diffusion coefficient value is explored and compared with the experimental data. The results show that Li+ diffusion coefficient in LiCoO2 material is in the order of 10- 12 to 10- 13 cm2/s, which is in agreement with the experimental data. Increased voltage value and decreased Li+ content raise the Li+ diffusion coefficient. In addition, the comparison of the Li+ diffusion coefficient along different axes of the crystal layer reveals that transporting lithium ions in a direction perpendicular to the layers of cathode material is more difficult than transporting them in a direction parallel to the layers. It can decrease the diffusion coefficient of Li+ by about 20\%, especially at high voltage value and low Li+ content. But the diffusion coefficient in both directions has the same order of magnitude, which may explain different values of Li+ diffusion coefficient in various experimental methods. Replacing Co3 + with Fe3 + for increasing the capacity and stability of cathode material may slightly diminish the values of Li+ diffusion coefficient, which is in agreement with the experimental results.},

Membrane distillation is an attractive technology, but suffers from low permeability, insufficient wetting and fouling resistance. In this work, membrane distillation coupling with electrochemistry was developed to achieve high desalination performance on superhydrophobic CNT hollow fiber membrane. The prepared membrane possessed higher permeability, better wetting resistance with permeate flux of 1.3--1.6 folds, water entry pressure of 1.4--1.7 folds as high as conventional PVDF and PP hollow fiber membranes. When it worked as cathode at a low voltage of 0.5V, its fouling resistance was further improved and no flux loss occurred in 36h operation for feed containing natural organic matter, while 15\% flux loss was observed under open circuit. Interestingly, the energy consumed by electrochemical assistance can be self-powered by thermoelectric power generating module from the temperature gradient between feed and permeate.},

The effect of the various operating conditions on the quality of the distillate water produced was investigated by Inductively Coupled Plasma/Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP/OES) and ion chromatography (IC). Five different feed solutions were studied such as the Arabian Gulf seawater, rejected brine from Qatari thermal desalination plants and artificial brine. A permeate flux of 35.6 LMH can be produced at temperature difference of 50 degrees C between hot and cold sides. The thermal energy efficiency of the system was analyzed and reached up to 22\%. The flow mode and turbulence promoter in feed channels were found to have a very important effect on the flux and energy efficiency. It was also noted that using spacers in the flow channels increase the distillate flux by more than 51\% as compared with a spacer-free system. The investigation has shown that the highest Gain Output Ratio (GOR) value can be obtained when using less saline feed solution at the highest feed temperature, lowest permeate temperature and lowest flow rate. Finally, the salt rejection rate throughout the conducted tests was very high ({$>$}99.9\%) and almost independent of any studied operational parameters. Eventually, DCMD has proven to be a feasible and effective technology capable of consistently producing high quality distillate from a very high salinity feed even with substantial quality difference compared to other desalination methods such as RO and MSF.

  abstract = {Simulating solute transport in heterogeneous porous media poses computational challenges due to the high-resolution meshing required for traditional solvers. To overcome these challenges, this study explores a mesh-free method based on deep learning to accelerate solute transport simulation. We employ Physics-informed Neural Networks (PiNN) with a periodic activation function to solve solute transport problems in both homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media governed by the advection-dispersion equation. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely on large training datasets, PiNNs use strong-form mathematical models to constrain the network in the training phase and simultaneously solve for multiple dependent or independent field variables, such as pressure and solute concentration fields. To demonstrate the effectiveness of using PiNNs with a periodic activation function to resolve solute transport in porous media, we construct PiNNs using two activation functions, sin and tanh, for seven case studies, including 1D and 2D scenarios. The accuracy of the PiNNs' predictions is then evaluated using absolute point error and mean square error metrics and compared to the ground truth solutions obtained analytically or numerically. Our results demonstrate that the PiNN with sin activation function, compared to tanh activation function, is up to two orders of magnitude more accurate and up to two times faster to train, especially in heterogeneous porous media. Moreover, PiNN's simultaneous predictions of pressure and concentration fields can reduce computational expenses in terms of inference time by three orders of magnitude compared to FEM simulations for two-dimensional cases.},

  abstract = {Reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) porous media from a single two-dimensional (2D) image or limited morphological information has been an outstanding problem. Specifically, multi-point statistics (MPS)-based methods have been proved to be effective and promising to address this problem. Besides, recently sampling-based MPS methods that reconstruct 3D microstructure layer by layer have attracted increasing attention, for its relatively lower computational cost and memory demand. However, due to the nature that one has to search and match multi-point information in a data structure like binary tree or list for each simulation, it is very time-consuming, especially for large template used to reconstruct geometrically complex media. In this paper, to overcome this challenge, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, an accelerating reconstruction method based on deep learning is proposed. Specially, conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN) is leveraged to model and characterize the relation between the sampling image which contains conditioning data and the target void-solid image. Unlike conventional MPS-based method generally performing simulation point by point, our method is able to directly translate the sampling image to the target one instantaneously, thus leading to a significant speedup factor (similar to 760 for 2D reconstruction and similar to 25 for 3D reconstruction on CPU). Meanwhile, to assess the performance of our method, we test it on sandstone samples, and two-point correlation function, lineal-path function and two-point cluster function, as well as local porosity distribution are quantitatively compared with those of the target microstructure. The comparison indicates that our method is of high efficiency while preserving good agreement of statistical functions with that of the target system. We remark that our approach opens the door to a new methodology that incorporating machine learning/deep learning techniques into conventional methods to address CPU- or memory-demanding issues in a wide range of related fields.

  abstract = {Stochastically reconstructing a three-dimensional (3D) structure of porous media from a given two-dimensional (2D) image is an outstanding problem. For such problem, despite that the big progress has been made on reconstruction methods such as optimization-based and multi-point statistics-based algorithms, however, the reconstruction of topologically complex or non-stationary materials is still not well addressed. Besides, the reconstruction efficiency is another remarkable challenge, and a 128(3) reconstruction using these methods generally requires several hours. In this paper, to overcome these problems, we propose a general end-to-end deep learning-based 3D reconstruction framework. Specially, the mapping (function) between a 2D slice and its 3D structure is first learned by a neural network. Then, the 3D reconstruction of a new 2D image using this mapping is instantaneous. For a 128(3) reconstruction, our method only requires 0.2s, thus achieving a 3.6 x 10(4) speedup factor compared with the classical methods. Besides, to yield diverse 3D structures for the same 2D input, a Gaussian noise is introduced into the network. Our approach is tested on two statistically isotropic materials and a non-stationary porous material, and evaluated in terms of both visual and quantitative comparisons. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is accurate, fast, and stable. The proposed framework also enables that theoretically an arbitrary number of constraints can be incorporated to further improve the reconstruction accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Porous media are ubiquitous in both nature and engineering applications. Therefore, their modeling and understanding is of vital importance. In contrast to direct acquisition of three-dimensional (3D) images of this type of medium, obtaining its subregion (s) such as 2D images or several small areas can be feasible. Therefore, reconstructing whole images from limited information is a primary technique in these types of cases. Given data in practice cannot generally be determined by users and may be incomplete or only partially informed, thus making existing reconstruction methods inaccurate or even ineffective. To overcome this shortcoming, in this study we propose a deep-learning-based framework for reconstructing full images from their much smaller subareas. In particular, conditional generative adversarial network is utilized to learn the mapping between the input (a partial image) and output (a full image). To ensure the reconstruction accuracy, two simple but effective objective functions are proposed and then coupled with the other two functions to jointly constrain the training procedure. Because of the inherent essence of this ill-posed problem, a Gaussian noise is introduced for producing reconstruction diversity, thus enabling the network to provide multiple candidate outputs. Our method is extensively tested on a variety of porous materials and validated by both visual inspection and quantitative comparison. It is shown to be accurate, stable, and even fast (similar to 0.08 s for a 128 x 128 image reconstruction). The proposed approach can be readily extended by, for example, incorporating user-defined conditional data and an arbitrary number of object functions into reconstruction, while being coupled with other reconstruction methods.},

For typical conditions, the sum of the additional terms exceeds 100 {$\mu$}m, which clearly shows that the flux is not inversely proportional to membrane thickness. Also, to a first approximation, the thermal efficiency is independent of membrane thickness. This work and the development of an overall mass-transfer coefficient for direct contact membrane distillation build upon the pioneering work of Giulio Sarti. Second, a reassessment of the traditional method for combining the Knudsen diffusion coefficient and the molecular diffusion coefficient suggests that the traditional sum of resistances approach engages in some double counting and thereby overestimates the resistance and consequently underestimates the flux.},

  abstract = {The Tangential Momentum Accommodation Coefficient (TMAC) is used to improve the accuracy of fluid flow calculations in the slip flow regime. Under such conditions (indicated by Knudsen number greater than 0.001), the continuum assumption that a fluid velocity at a solid surface is equal to the surface velocity is inaccurate because relatively significant fluid ``slip'' occurs at the surface. Prior work has not led to a method to quickly estimate a value for TMAC it is frequently assumed. In this work, Molecular Dynamics techniques are used to study the impacts of individual gas atoms upon solid surfaces to understand how approach velocity, crystal geometry and interatomic forces affect the scattering of the gas atoms, specifically from the perspective of tangential momentum. It is a logical step in the development of a comprehensive technique to estimate total coefficient values to be used by those investigating flows in microand nano-channels or on orbit spacecraft where slip flow occurs. TMAC can also help analysis in transitional or free molecular regimes of flow.},

We have used Fizeau interferometry to measure directly the capillary condensation of water in a wedge between fused silica surfaces. Measurements were made at relative vapour pressures (P/Ps) from 0.996 down to 0.945, corresponding to theoretical meniscus radii from {\textasciitilde}120 to 9nm.

In this respect, the reference work par excellence is that of Correns (Discuss Faraday Soc 5:267-271, 1949) who shows a good correlation between calculated and measured crystallization pressures. However, concerns about both the thermodynamic derivation and the experimental conditions raise the question about why Correns could have obtained such a good correlation.

  abstract = {In this study, a novel chitosan--resole--pectin aerogel (CS--R--P) was created from a sol--gel reaction with a solution of Cs and P with resole by a freeze-drying technique, and this adsorbent was proposed for the removal of methylene blue (MB). In addition, with the use of an artificial intelligence technique known as an artificial neural network (ANN), this material was modeled and optimized. Its physical morphology and chemical composition were also characterized with FTIR and XPS, and its adsorption properties were analyzed. For modeling the adsorption process, three main parameters were used: the chitosan--resole--pectin concentration (45--75\%), thermal treatment (6--36 h), and known concentrations of methylene blue (25--50 and 100 mg/L), established on the Box--Behnken design. The ANN was coupled with the improved gray wolf optimization (IWGO) metaheuristic algorithm, achieving a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.99. The characterization indicates that the surface of the aerogels was micro- and mesoporous, the resole gave physical stability, and the polysaccharide base delivered the functional groups necessary for dye adsorption; the aerogels were successful dye adsorbents with a qe of 12.44 mg/g. Finally, the physical and chemical sorption was ascertainable with an adsorption that followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The MB adsorption was clearly occurring though cation exchange and hydrogen binding as observed in the chemical composition. The ANN with the gray wolf optimizer was used for the prediction of the best operating parameters for MB removal, applying the following conditions---the CS--R--P aerogel concentration (52/30/18), the thermal treatment (9.12 h), and the initial concentration of methylene blue (37 mg/L)---achieving a 94.6\% removal. These conclusions suggest that using artificial intelligence such as an ANN can provide an efficient and practical model for maximizing the removal action of new aerogels based on chitosan.},

Since the work of adhesion can be very appreciably increased by interfacial acid-base bonding with concomitant increases in adhesive bond strength, it is important to understand the acid-base character of polymers and of the surface sites of substrates or of the reinforcing fillers of polymer composites. The best known acid-base bonds are the hydrogen bonds; these are typical of acid-base bonds, with interaction energies dependent on the acidity of the hydrogen donor and on the basicity of the hydrogen acceptor. The strengths of the acidic or basic sites of polymers and of inorganic substrates can be easily determined by spectroscopic or calorimetric methods, and from this information one can start to predict the strengths of adhesive bonds. An important application of the new knowledge of interfacial acid-base bonding is the predictable enhancement of interfacial bonding accomplished by surface modification of inorganic surfaces to enhance the interfacial acid-base interactions.},

Nanocomposites with noble metals and other porous materials have been employed to generate solar vapor at a high light intensity. However, large-scale applications of the nanocomposites based on noble metals are restricted due to their high cost, complex preparation, and low recycling stability. Herein, we report a simple method toward fabricating graphene aerogel (GA) from graphene oxides only by photoreduction, which is for the first time used to harvest solar energy. GA can not only convert almost the entire incident solar light to heat energy but can also self-float on the surface of water and pump the interface water forming a constant water steam. Solar steam generation efficiencies of 53.6 {\textpm} 2.5\% and 82.7 {\textpm} 2.5\% are achieved at light intensities of 1 and 10 kW m--2, respectively. Furthermore, this efficiency is still kept at a high value, and the morphology of GA is hardly broken after 10 cycles of testing. This technology of steam generation through efficiently harvesting solar energy is highly promising for sterilization of waste and seawater desalination.},

Here, we introduced a new solar absorber of modified graphene aerogel (MGA) prepared by one-step hydrothermal method and oxygen plasma treatment for rapid and efficient solar steam generation. The obtained MGA possesses interconnected 3D porous networks formed by randomly construction of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets and hydrophilic surface due to effective oxygen implant by oxygen plasma. Furthermore, under one sun illumination, MGA exhibited a high evaporation efficiency of 76.9\%, which is not only due to the intrinsic property of rGO with excellent light absorption but also attributed to the particular structural merits of MGA---hydrophilic surface for water supplying and connected networks for steam escaping as well as porous matrix with low thermal conductivity. The cyclic tests confirmed that MGA still maintained a stable performance of solar steam generation even when it repeated multiple times. This new assembly demonstrated here is efficient and reusable for applications in rapid solar seawater desalination and wastewater treatment in remote area.},

To that aim, we combine molecular dynamics simulations and an analytical model considering the details of hydrodynamics in the membrane and at the tube entrances. The analytical model and the simulation results match quantitatively, highlighting the need to take into account both thermodynamics and hydrodynamics to predict thermo-osmotic flows through membranes. We show that, despite viscous entrance effects and a thermal short-circuit mechanism, CNT membranes can generate very fast thermo-osmotic flows, which can overcome the osmotic pressure of seawater. We then show that in small tubes confinement has a complex effect on the flow and can even reverse the flow direction. Beyond CNT membranes, our analytical model can guide the search for other membranes to generate fast and robust thermo-osmotic flows.},

Despite their very high stiffness and strength1, such lightweight materials require energy- and labour-intensive fabrication processes2, exhibit typically brittle fracture and are difficult to shape and recycle3,4. This is in stark contrast to lightweight biological materials such as bone, silk and wood, which form by directed self-assembly into complex, hierarchically structured shapes with outstanding mechanical properties5--11, and are circularly integrated into the environment. Here we demonstrate a three-dimensional~(3D) printing approach to generate recyclable lightweight structures with hierarchical architectures, complex geometries and unprecedented stiffness and toughness. Their features arise from the self-assembly of liquid-crystal polymer molecules into highly oriented domains during extrusion of the molten feedstock material. By orienting the molecular domains with the print path, we are able to reinforce the polymer structure according to the expected mechanical stresses, leading to stiffness, strength and toughness that outperform state-of-the-art 3D-printed polymers by an order of magnitude and are comparable with the highest-performance lightweight composites1,12. The ability to combine the top-down shaping freedom of 3D printing with bottom-up molecular control over polymer orientation opens up the possibility to freely design and realize structures without the typical restrictions of current manufacturing processes.},

An assumption based on the fact that gas is a compressible viscous fluid is introduced in a modified DGM equation (MDGM). Polytropic equation of state is used to estimate the variation of gas temperature along the pores of membrane. The gas temperature influences its viscosity, which affects its flow resistance through membrane. The MDGM equations for single gases are provided by incorporating polytropic equation of state when integrating the differential DGM flux equation. The MDGM for single gases can be used in modeling the inconsistencies in using DGM in literature and it is verified by published experimental data through fitting the distinguished trends under DGM into one line. The MDGM reveals that the temperature may decrease in membrane pores and exit side, and the phase change of vapor may be one of the inducements for pore wetting in MD.},

  abstract = {Surfaces containing 4 {\texttimes} 8 {\texttimes} 40 {$\mu$}m staggered rhombus posts were hydrophobized using two methods. One, using a dimethyldichlorosilane reaction in the vapor phase, introduces a smooth modified layer, and the other, a solution reaction using methyltrichlorosilane, imparts a second (nanoscopic) length scale of topography. The smooth modified surface exhibits contact angles of {\texttheta}A/{\texttheta}R = 176{$^\circ$}/156{$^\circ$}. Arguments are made that the pinning of the receding contact line by the post tops (with {\texttheta}A/{\texttheta}R = 104{$^\circ$}/103{$^\circ$}) is responsible for the hysteresis. The second level of topography raises the contact angles of the post tops and the macroscopic sample to {\texttheta}A/{\texttheta}R = {$>$}176{$^\circ$}/{$>$}176{$^\circ$} and eliminates hysteresis. The increase in Laplace pressure due to the increase in the advancing contact angle of the post tops is a second reason that two length scales of topography are important.},

Though desalination can provide a climate-independent source of clean water, the process requires a high energy consumption. Emerging advancement of photothermal nanomaterials and the urgent demand for a green technology transition have reinvigorated the established solar distillation technology. The current development of photothermal vaporization focuses on material innovation and interfacial heating, which largely emphasizes vapor generation efficiency, without considering pragmatic water collection. Moreover, salt accumulation is another critical issue of seawater solar-driven vaporization. The incorporation of photothermal materials into a photothermal membrane distillation (PMD) solar evaporator design harmoniously resolves these issues through combination of renewable energy and efficient interfacial distillation, to achieve the ultimate goal of practical saline water into freshwater conversion. At this juncture, it is imperative to review the recent opportunities and progresses of the PMD system. Here, the fundamental photothermal processes, strategies for efficient evaporator design, evaluation of various criteria for photothermal material incorporation with desired properties, discussions on desalination, water treatment, and energy generation applications are covered. Guidelines in material and system designs to further advance the PMD system that is highly promising in delivering portable water for both large-scale and decentralized systems are provided.},

The obtained monolithic carbon material can rebound a steel ball in spring-like fashion with fast recovery speed ({$\sim$}580\,mm\,s-1), and demonstrates complete recovery and small energy dissipation ({$\sim$}0.2) in each compress-release cycle, even under 90\% strain. Particularly, the material can maintain structural integrity after more than 106 cycles at 20\% strain and 2.5 {\texttimes} 105 cycles at 50\% strain. This structural material, although constructed using an intrinsically brittle carbon constituent, is simultaneously super-elastic, highly compressible and fatigue resistant to a degree even greater than that of previously reported compressible foams mainly made from more robust constituents.},

  abstract = {Classical nucleation theory (CNT) is based on the notion of critical nuclei serving as transition states between supersaturated solutions and growing particles. Their excess standard free energy depends on supersaturation, and determines the height of the barrier for phase separation. However, predictions of CNT nucleation rates can deviate from experimental observations by many orders of magnitude. We argue that this is due to oversimplifications within CNT, rendering the critical nucleus essentially a conceptual notion, rather than a truly existing physical entity. Still, given adequate parametrization, CNT is useful for predicting and explaining nucleation phenomena, since it is currently the only quantitative framework at hand. In the recent years, we have been introducing an alternative theory, the so-called pre-nucleation cluster (PNC) pathway. The truly ``non-classical'' aspect of the PNC pathway is the realization that critical nuclei, as defined within CNT, are not the key to nucleation, but that the transition state relevant for phase separation is based on a change in dynamics of PNCs rather than their size. We provide a summary of CNT and the PNC pathway, thereby highlighting this major difference. The discussion of recent works claiming to provide scientific evidence against the existence of PNCs reveals that such claims are indeed void. Moreover, we illustrate that an erroneous interpretation of the concentration dependence of the free energy has led to a postulated rationalization of the standard free energy of ion pairs and stable ion associates within CNT, which is not sustainable. In fact, stable ion associates are stuck in a free energy trap from the viewpoint of CNT and cannot be considered in a straightforward manner. On the other hand, the notions of the PNC pathway, by dismissing the idea of the CNT-type critical nucleus as a required transition state, overcome this issue. While a quantitative theory of the PNC pathway is eagerly anticipated, the rationalization of experimental observations that are inconsistent with CNT proves its qualitative explanatory power, underpinning great promise towards a better understanding of, for instance, polymorph selection and crystallization control by additives.},

Prenucleation clusters are solutes with ``molecular'' character in aqueous solution. It becomes evident that the stable clusters may have been concealed by the so-called ion pair concept and activity effects. We show that non-classical nucleation via stable prenucleation clusters is a highly valuable concept for a novel understanding of phenomena observed in bio- and biomimetic mineralization, which however may hardly be rationalized by means of classical nucleation theory. The importance to combine experimental and theoretical studies is emphasized.},

Huge amounts of carbon dioxide are retained as carbonate ions, and calcium ions represent a major contribution to water hardness. Despite its relevance, little is known about the precipitation mechanism of calcium carbonate, and specified complex crystal structures challenge the classical view on nucleation considering the formation of metastable ion clusters. We demonstrate that dissolved calcium carbonate in fact contains stable prenucleation ion clusters forming even in undersaturated solution. The cluster formation can be characterized by means of equilibrium thermodynamics, applying a multiple- binding model, which allows for structural preformation. Stable clusters are the relevant species in calcium carbonate nucleation. Such mechanisms may also be important for the crystallization of other minerals.},

  abstract = {Recent studies of membrane distillation have shown varying effects on flux when sparingly soluble salts of calcium precipitate. Another common sparingly soluble mineral often found in brackish water feeds is silica. Because of its normal solubility silica is stable to higher concentrations at higher temperature than at room temperature and this should allow further water recovery and volume reduction of brackish water RO brines by membrane distillation. We report here on a series of experiments conducted with hollow fiber and flat sheet DCMD modules with silica solutions with saturation indices in the range 1.5 to 2.2 at temperatures of 60--75 {$^\circ$}C. We found that unlike previous work on calcium salt scalants in cross-flow hollow fiber modules, in the same type of modules silica fouling consistently caused significant flux decline after 2--7 h effective induction time, with declines of up to 70\%. In flat sheet modules, the induction time for 400 mg/L silica solutions at 75 {$^\circ$}C was 4--7 h independent of initial flux ranging from 15 to 50 kg/m2-h, implying very different supersaturations at the membrane surface. Scanning electron microscopy studies of silica fouled membranes support a proposed model that the fouling occurs by deposition of colloidal silica in the pore mouths leading to partial wetting followed by aggravated temperature and concentration polarization leading to a cascade of precipitation that then blocks the pore to vapor transport.},

This review paper discusses the application of PV-T and CPV-T energy for desalination approaches such as humidification dehumidification (HDH), multi-effect distil\- lation (MED), reverse osmosis (RO), solar stills, membrane distillation (MD), and mechanical vacuum compression (MVC). Current methods for assessing the economic viability of PV-T and CPV-T polygeneration systems, including the estimation of installation and balance-of-system cost, price per peak power, feed-in-tariff, and energy pay-back period are discussed. Full-scale and commercial PV-T and CPV-T systems applicable in desalination processes are also reviewed. Research and development activities on polygeneration PV-T and CPVT systems have continued to improve. However, research on optimum generation of co-products from these systems needs to be intensified in order to ensure widespread practical application. Polygeneration from PV-T systems integrated with desalination have been shown to provide higher efficiencies in grid-connected or stand-alone applications than the single-product systems. For much higher efficiencies, the incorporation of nanofluids as the heat transfer medium and the use of absorbers that are less than 50\% covered by PV module have been recommended. On the economic side, the installation costs of PV-T systems are still higher than those of their PV counterparts but PV-T systems provide less environmental impacts and cost reduction in the long run.},

  abstract = {Super-hydrophobic surfaces are quite common in nature, inspiring people to continually explore its water-repellence property and applications to our lives. It has been generally agreed that the property of super-hydrophobicity is mainly contributed by the microscale or nanoscale (or even smaller) architecture on the surface. Besides, there is an energy barrier between the Cassie-Baxter wetting state and the Wenzel wetting state. An optimized square post micro structure with truncated square pyramid geometry is introduced in this work to increase the energy barrier, enhancing the robustness of super-hydrophobicity. Theoretical analysis is conducted based on the wetting transition energy curves. Numerical simulation based on a phase-field lattice Boltzmann method is carried out to verify the theoretical analysis. The numerical simulation agrees well with the theoretical analysis, showing the positive significance of the proposed micro structure. Furthermore, another novel micro structure of rough surface is presented, which combines the advantages of truncated pyramid geometry and noncommunicating roughness elements. Theoretical analysis shows that the novel micro structure of rough surface can effectively hinder the Cassie-Baxter state to Wenzel state transition, furtherly enhancing the robustness of the surface hydrophobicity.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is a promising separation technology that can help reducing the worldwide water energy stress in a sustainable way. MD uses low-grade thermal energy to drive desalination, to remove nonvolatile contaminants or to recover other components. In MD, the vapor from an aqueous solution crosses a hydrophobic membrane and then it condensates at the other side of the membrane, resulting in a high-quality distillate. Recent advances in MD have demonstrated the viability of this technology for different water purification applications. This article presents a critical review of MD that focuses on applications for sustainable water production and on issues that must be addressed to improve the performance of MD desalination systems. To achieve sustainable desalination, different MD systems powered by solar, geothermal, and waste energy have been designed and evaluated, as well as hybrid systems that allow accomplishing zero liquid discharge. To achieve improved desalination, new membranes, membrane modules and MD configurations have been proposed in the last years. Membrane fouling and scaling has been found to be one of the main issues that limits MD at large-scale. Research gaps are highlighted and areas for further research in terms of sustainability and to improve the performance of MD systems are proposed.},

We showed that with excitation at 445 nm, the fluorescence lifetime of both SypHer3s and SypHerExtra strongly depend on pH. Using FLIM microscopy in live eukaryotic cells, we demonstrated that SypHerExtra can be successfully used to determine extracellular pH, while SypHer3s can be applied to measure intracellular pH. Thus, these two sensors are suitable for quantitative measurements using the FLIM method, to determine intracellular and extracellular pH in a range from pH 7.5 to 9.5 in different biological systems.},

Deviations of the channels from a cylindrical form, resolved with electron microscopy down to subnanometer scales, quantitatively account for a reduced diffusivity as compared to Knudsen diffusion in ideal tubular channels.

Precipitation of calcium sulphate was also observed during the production of demineralised water when high values of the water recovery coefficient (above 90 \%) were used. In this case, the formed precipitate also contained CaCO3, the co-precipitation of which significantly changed the properties of the scaling layer. The precipitate containing both CaSO4 and CaCO3 was formed mainly on the membrane surface and it could easily be removed by rinsing the module with a HCl solution.},

To assess the fouling phenomena one of the MD modules was subjected to autopsy after several weeks of process duration. A severe fouling of the membrane surface caused by the iron oxides was found. The morphology and composition of the precipitated layer were studied using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersion spectrometry (EDS).

An increase of the permeate flux from 770 to 830 dm3/m2d was observed due to a partial dissolution of deposit from the membrane surface by hydrochloric acid. However, the dissolution all of the deposit (also including that precipitated into the pores) caused a partial wettability of the membranes, therefore the permeate flux was decreased from 830 to 650 dm3/m2d. The initial membrane permeability was restored for a short time, when the membranes were subjected to drying.},

The morphology and composition of the fouling layer were studied using Fourier transform infrared with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with the energy dispersing spectrometry. Fouling with various intensity was observed in most of the studied cases. Permeate flux decline was mainly caused by an increase in the heat resistance of the fouling layer. However in the case of non-porous deposit, a magnitude of the permeate flux was also determined by a resistance of water transport through the deposit layer. It was found the deposits were formed not only on the membrane surface, but also inside the pores. Salt crystallization in the membrane pores besides their wetting, also caused the mechanical damage of the membrane structure. The intensity of the fouling can be limited by the pretreatment of feed and a selection of the operating conditions of membrane distillation.},

These membranes exhibited a similar morphology, but one of them has an additional low porosity layer on the internal surface of capillaries. The changes of membrane performance during MD process of tap water were investigated. The presence of low porosity layer (thickness below 1 ␮m) caused that the air permeability was reduced from 1.365 to 0.863 dm3/m2 s kPa, whereas the MD permeate flux was decreased only by 15\%. A significantly larger decline of the flux was caused by CaCO3 deposit formed during distillation of tap water. This deposit was removed every 30--70 h by rinsing the modules with a 2--5 wt.\% HCl. Unfortunately, a repetition of this operation several times resulted in a gradual decline of the maximum permeate flux (distilled water as a feed). However, the module efficiency with the membranes covered by a surface layer of low porosity was found to decreases twice as slowly.

The resistance to wettability of capillary polypropylene membranes has been investigated in this work. The SEM-EDS investigations revealed that the pores located up to 100{$\mu$}m from the membrane surface were filled by the feed during the production of demineralized water over a period of 4500h. However, the pores located inside the membrane wall were still dry and no feed leakage was observed. Both scaling and polypropylene degradation were indicated as the major reason for partial membrane wettability. The SEM-EDS, XRD and FTIR methods were used for investigations of polypropylene degradation, and material cracking and the presence of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups on the membrane surface has been identified. The membranes irradiated by UV light or stored up to 9 years in air were used to evaluate the membrane wetting caused by the products of polymer oxidation. The membrane samples were soaked in either water or a concentrated solution of NaCl at temperature of 343K, and their wettability was evaluated on the basis of their variations in the air permeability. It was found that the products of polypropylene oxidation significantly accelerated the degree of wettability during the first 30 days of investigations, but after 60 days the results were similar. The soaked membrane samples wetted faster in NaCl solutions than those soaked in distilled water, which came as a result of the chemical reactions of salt with the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups found on the polypropylene surface.},

Tap water containing 2.16mmol HCO3-dm-3, which was additionally enriched with bicarbonates (alkalinity 2.72mmol HCO3-dm-3 and 3.61mmol HCO3-dm-3) was used in the study. To generate a magnetic field a commercial device, called the magnetizer, was used. The magnetic field originated from two S--S type permanent magnets, 0.1T each. For comparison purposes the membrane distillation with/without a magnetic pre-treatment of the feed were conducted. The distillation process proceeded at 358K. When the feed was warmed up, large amounts of CaCO3 deposit were formed inside the experimental installation. SEM--EDS and XRD were used to investigate the chemical composition and morphology of the precipitate. The precipitate was also forming on the membrane surfaces, which resulted in a decrease of modules efficiency. It was found that as a result of magnetic pre-treatment larger crystallites were formed and the deposit was more porous. For this reason a decrease in the permeate flux was significantly smaller when the magnetizer was used. The CaCO3 deposit was found to be mostly in the form of calcite in each investigated case.},

  abstract = {The results of the over 3 years' time research on the direct contact membrane distillation applied for production of the demineralised water have been presented. The hydrophobic capillary polypropylene membranes (Accurel PP S6/2) were used in these studies. The inlet temperature of the feed and the distillate was 353 and 293K, respectively. The membranes were found to be thermally stable, and good separation characteristics was maintained throughout the whole period of the investigations. The SEM observations of the capillary membrane confirmed that their morphology remained unchanged. It was found that water (permeate from reverse osmosis process) did not cause the wetting of the used membranes despite a long-term membrane module exploitation. The precipitation of CaCO3 on the membrane surface was observed when tap water was used directly as a feed. A partial wetting of the membrane was found in this case. The wettability resulted in the increased electrical conductivity of the distillate obtained from 0.9 to 2.5{$\mu$}S/cm.},

The influence of the process conditions, such as temperature and brine concentration on the permeate flux, was investigated. The saturated NaCl solutions and distilled water were used as a stripping solution and feed, respectively. A continuous regeneration of stripping solution was conducted using a method of natural evaporation from the surface of Bia{\l}ecki rings to the air surrounding the installation. The possibilities of application of Accurel PP S6/2 hydrophobic polypropylene membranes were tested. It was studied whether a saturation stripping solution does not cause scaling and wettability of membranes. It was found that most of the pores in the used membranes were non-wetted, and the salt retention over 99\% was maintained during a study period. However, the obtained permeate flux was decreased by 10--20\%. The SEM examinations revealed that it was caused by amorphous deposit, which was formed on the membrane surface on the brine side. The SEM--EDS analysis demonstrated that the deposit composition mainly included Si and O.},

The precipitation of salt deposit on the membrane surface was observed during the water demineralisation, especially in the first stage of MD.

It was confirmed that membranes with lower wall thickness and larger pore size provide higher yields of the process. The studies demonstrated that the pores of used membranes located close to the external surface of capillaries are several times larger than those located inside the membrane wall. Based on air permeability measurements it was found that external surface of the membranes with such large pores was completely wetted by water after 50--80 h of membrane distillation. However, the pores located inside the wall with the diameter below 1 {$\mu$}m were not wetted and electrical conductivity of the obtained distillate was maintained at the level of 3--6 {$\mu$}S cm-1.},

Based on the data, and a different interpretation of the anisotropic SAXS pattern, we propose a slightly different colloidal structure of the fibers, than what is commonly assumed for regenerated cellulose fibers. Fibers with two different degrees of orientation, as produced by different draw ratios, DR\,=\,2 and 15, respectively, are analyzed. The 2D SAXS pattern is highly anisotropic with striking cross-like pattern, having scattering predominantly perpendicular and parallel to the fiber axis. This cross-like pattern suggest a colloidal structure with oriented crystalline lamellae of ca. 10~nm thickness, embedded within a continuous matrix of amorphous cellulose. The lamellae are oriented with their normal parallel with the fiber axis. Complementary wide angle X-ray diffraction data confirm that the lamellae normal direction corresponds to the cellulose chain direction (c-direction) in the monoclinic cellulose crystal (Cellulose II).

However, distillate quality deterioration has been reported in field tests of solar-powered MD systems. This work investigates the effects of salt deposition, resulting from membrane dry-out, on the properties of two types of commercial hydrophobic membranes commonly used for MD purposes. The membranes are made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF). The intermittent operation was simulated by a series of wet/dry cycles using seawater at MD operational temperatures. Membrane properties including surface contact angle, gas permeability, and mechanical strength were assessed, along with other structural characteristics like pore size distribution. The morphology of the salt-exposed membranes was also investigated using SEM and EDS. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out to assess surface morphology and quantify surface roughness, in relation to the fouling process. AFM was combined with the use of a CaCO3 colloid probe to assess adhesion forces between CaCO3 and the membranes. DCMD experiments were conducted to study the post-fouling performance of the membranes in the MD process. Significant scaling was detected starting from the first week of seawater exposure, as evidenced by all the characterization techniques used. PVDF and PTFE membranes were observed to behave somewhat differently under these fouling conditions. DCMD experiments proved that membrane wetting was exacerbated by intermittent operation.},

The fouling and the damage endured by the MD membranes during intermittent long-term (2010--2013) solar-powered operation in the pilot plant were assessed and characterized. Different cleaning strategies were used to remove the fouling layer and restore the membrane properties. Data regarding relevant membrane characteristics for the MD process, such as contact angle, gas permeability, porosity, liquid entry pressure, mechanical strength, etc., and their relationship with the membrane performance under MD operation were discussed and analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to study the morphology of the fouled and cleaned membranes and characterize the membrane damage. The identified best cleaning procedure was then applied in the MD plant system at PSA. Results suggested that cleaning effectively removed a great part of the fouling and reduced the wetting of the membranes. However, this improvement was offset by the effect of inactive periods during which wetting processes were favored.},

  abstract = {Direct contact membrane distillation experiments were carried out under this work to study the influence of operational variables on membrane wetting. In the first part of this work, experiments were designed according to a Box-Behnken methodology and results were analyzed statistically using Pearson correlation coefficients, principal component/factor analysis and cluster analysis. The independent operational parameters were the temperatures of both the hot and cold streams (Tf, Tc) and their flow rates (Ff, Fc). The analyzed responses were the time and rate of wetting along with distillate flux. Statistical analysis showed strong evidence of a relationship between the selected variables and the wetting patterns. In general, parameters enhancing flux production led to suppression of wetting (both delayed wetting and reduced wetting rate). The second part of the work focused on reversing the wetting with minimal operation disruption by varying the operational parameters. The data generated helped in understanding the salt passage and wetting mechanisms. The wetting hypothesis developed herein is based on water bridging as a consequence of the weak hydrophobicity of the PVDF membrane and a net absolute transmembrane pressure. Data were analyzed through the Peclet number, the Poiseuille flow and a mass balance in order to understand the interplay between diffusion and convection/advection. High transmembrane temperature ({$\Delta$}T) ({$\Delta$}T=Tf-Tc) counteracts the build-up of a net absolute transmembrane pressure and reduces the viscous liquid flux. In this case, the diffusion of salt through the stagnant water layer in the membrane pores (a much slower mechanism) becomes more important and the wetting rate can be reduced and further reversed.},

The processes on silica gels Si-40, Si-60, and Si-100 are compared to the evaporation of nanodroplets in the gas phase and evaporation of water, 1-butanol, and n-hexane from fumed silica A-300 at room temperature. The evaporation rate k(T) depends strongly on the characteristics of adsorbates (molecular weight, intermolecular bond type and strength, surface tension, boiling, Tb and critical, Tc temperatures) and adsorbents (surface structure, porosity characteristics), and it is exponential function of temperature. Different sequence order of the values of Tb and Tc for water and butanol lead to intersection of curves of evaporation rate (or time) vs. temperature between Tb and Tc. For other liquids, the curve position over the used temperature range correlates to the value of Tb; however, the gap between curves is not constant vs. T.

The silica deposits cause operational problems and may even clog pipelines and injection drillholes. The rate of silica-scale formation can be reduced by ageing amorphous silica super-saturated waters, thus allowing the aqueous silica in excess of saturation to polymerize. Polymeric silica shows less tendency to precipitate from solution than monomeric silica. Studies of separated water from the Nesjavellir geothermal power station, Iceland, indicate that silica-scale formation can be avoided during heat extraction by rapid cooling of the water in ``capillary heat exchangers'', followed by ageing the water for 1--2h and subsequently mixing it with condensed steam. It is thus possible to avoid scale formation during injection of the amorphous silica super-saturated water leaving the heat exchanger.},

Here we report a multiscale design of hypocrystalline zircon nanofibrous aerogels with a zig-zag architecture that leads to exceptional thermomechanical stability and ultralow thermal conductivity at high temperatures. The aerogels show a near-zero Poisson's ratio (3.3\,{\texttimes}\,10               -4               ) and a near-zero thermal expansion coefficient (1.2\,{\texttimes}\,10               -7               per degree Celsius), which ensures excellent structural flexibility and thermomechanical properties. They show high thermal stability with ultralow strength degradation (less than 1\,per cent) after sharp thermal shocks, and a high working temperature (up to 1,300\,degrees Celsius). By deliberately entrapping residue carbon species in the constituent hypocrystalline zircon fibres, we substantially reduce the thermal radiation heat transfer and achieve one of the lowest high-temperature thermal conductivities among ceramic aerogels so far---104\,milliwatts per metre per kelvin at 1,000\,degrees Celsius. The combined thermomechanical and thermal insulating properties offer an attractive material system for robust thermal insulation under extreme conditions.},

  abstract = {With LAMMPS software, the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations study was conducted for the membrane distillation process with the hydrophobic {$\alpha$}-Al2O3 ceramic membrane (HCM). It could further help to explain the macroscopic laws and phenomena that appeared in the membrane distillation tests with HCM. In this study, the average temperature (Tr) of raw water and the negative pressure (Pcon) on the cold side of HCM were taken as the investigation variables to research the microscopic water desalination performance of HCM, transport/diffusion properties of water molecules, and related mechanisms. The results showed that the root means square displacement (MSD) of water molecules on the cold side of HCM positively changed with time by the linear trend. The height of the transmembrane energy barrier mainly depends on the atomic structure of the HCM. The diffusion type of free-state water molecules in the membrane micropores of HCM was the main ballistic-transport-like accompanied by rebound-jump. The influence level of Tr on the number of water molecules in the cold side of HCM was much greater than that of Pcon under the dynamic equilibrium state. The essential reason Tr determined the HCM molecular flux was that it changed the hydrogen bond lifetime in the microporous membrane of HCM.},

This study demonstrates an innovative method for fabricating an omniphobic membrane that is simple and facile compared to other methods such as wet/dry etching and photolithography. The surface morphology of springtails was imitated using electrospraying technique to coat a polyvinylidene fluoride substrate with concave-shaped polystyrene beads that were successfully developed by controlling the electrical traction (voltage) and air resistance (humidity). Then, the lipid coating of springtail surfaces was mimicked by dip-coating the membrane in a low-toxicity short-chain perfluoropolyether lubricant. The concave structure's tiny air pockets increased membrane hydrophobicity significantly, indicated by the fact that the first round of water bouncing took only 16.3\,ms. Finally, in MD treatment of seawater containing 1.0\,mM sodium dodecyl sulfate, the optimized omniphobic membrane maintained a stable 99.9\% salt rejection rate.},

The inherent advantages of PAspNa, such as good water solubility, high osmotic pressure, and nontoxicity, were first examined through a series of physicochemical analyses and atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Then, lab-scale FO tests were performed to evaluate its suitability in practical processes. Compared to other conventional inorganic solutes, PAspNa showed comparable water flux but significantly lower reverse solute flux, demonstrating its suitability as a draw solute. Moreover, fouling experiments using synthetic wastewater as a feed solution demonstrated that PAspNa reversely flowed to the feed side reduced inorganic scaling on the membrane active layer. The recyclability of PAspNa was studied using both nanofiltration (NF) and membrane distillation (MD) processes, and the results exhibited its ease of recovery.

  abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have received significant attention as a unified framework for forward, inverse, and surrogate modeling of problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Training PINNs for forward problems, however, pose significant challenges, mainly because of the complex non-convex and multi-objective loss function. In this work, we present a PINN approach to solving the equations of coupled flow and deformation in porous media for both single-phase and multiphase flow. To this end, we construct the solution space using multi-layer neural networks. Due to the dynamics of the problem, we find that incorporating multiple differential relations into the loss function results in an unstable optimization problem, meaning that sometimes it converges to the trivial null solution, other times it moves very far from the expected solution. We report a dimensionless form of the coupled governing equations that we find most favorable to the optimizer. Additionally, we propose a sequential training approach based on the stress-split algorithms of poromechanics. Notably, we find that sequential training based on stress-split performs well for different problems, while the classical strain-split algorithm shows an unstable behavior similar to what is reported in the context of finite element solvers. We use the approach to solve benchmark problems of poroelasticity, including Mandel's consolidation problem, Barry-Mercer's injection-production problem, and a reference two-phase drainage problem.

  abstract = {Ice formation is ubiquitous in nature, with important consequences in a variety of environments, including biological cells, soil, aircraft, transportation infrastructure, and atmospheric clouds. However, its intrinsic kinetics and microscopic mechanism are difficult to discern with current experiments. Molecular simulations of ice nucleation are also challenging, and direct rate calculations have only been performed for coarse-grained models of water. For molecular models, only indirect estimates have been obtained, e.g., by assuming the validity of classical nucleation theory. We use a path sampling approach to perform, to our knowledge, the first direct rate calculation of homogeneous nucleation of ice in a molecular model of water. We use TIP4P/Ice, the most accurate among existing molecular models for studying ice polymorphs. By using a novel topological approach to distinguish different polymorphs, we are able to identify a freezing mechanism that involves a competition between cubic and hexagonal ice in the early stages of nucleation. In this competition, the cubic polymorph takes over because the addition of new topological structural motifs consistent with cubic ice leads to the formation of more compact crystallites. This is not true for topological hexagonal motifs, which give rise to elongated crystallites that are not able to grow. This leads to transition states that are rich in cubic ice, and not the thermodynamically stable hexagonal polymorph. This mechanism provides a molecular explanation for the earlier experimental and computational observations of the preference for cubic ice in the literature.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is an emerging green technology, but very few reports are available on its use for treating oily feeds, despite produced water representing a significant source of oily wastewater. Accordingly, this study was targeted at understanding the primary impediments of oily water MD by systematically investigating the influence of the key components (namely, oil-in-water emulsion, surfactant and salt) in such feeds. When the feed contained all three components typical in produced water, the MD performance severely deteriorated in terms of permeate flux and quality. Interestingly, for feeds containing oil or SDS or NaCl alone, the MD performance was reasonable, which indicates each component on its own did not impact the MD process significantly. Furthermore, the performance was also reasonable when the feed contained oil and NaCl, and improved when the feed contained oil and SDS. The adverse impact on the MD process was thereby traced to the combined presence of SDS and NaCl. Even in the absence of oil, increasing the concentrations of SDS and NaCl in the feed progressively deteriorated the permeate flux and quality. Therefore, to use MD for treating oily feeds necessitates a pre-treatment step to remove or significantly dilute either the surfactant or the salt. More understanding of the interaction between NaCl and SDS via molecular dynamics simulations would be useful to not only provide information on the interaction strength but also on means to circumvent such issues.},

Currently, numerous techniques such as chemical precipitation, coagulation, ion-exchange, filtration, reverse osmosis, biological treatment and physical adsorption are presented by researchers for removing and recycling heavy metal ions from wastewater. Among these methods, adsorption approach is one of the most efficient techniques for the elimination of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions. There are a number of low cost absorbent such as agricultural and industrial solid waste such as lingo-cellulosic materials, wheat bran, peanut shell, moss peat, fly ash, bagasse, tree fern, gram husk, nanostructures (such as TiO2, SiO2, SnO2, ZnO, etc.), 3D porous structures (aerogels), etc. which have been developed and tested to efficient removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater. In this study, a critical review of the applications of aerogels in water and sewage purifications is performed. For this reason, different kinds of aerogel namely organic, inorganic and organic-inorganic hybrid aerogels are investigated. It is concluded that the most applicable aerogels used in these studies are graphene-based aerogels due to more porous structure as well as simplification of their modification. Also, in this review paper, for the first time we summarized and highlighted the recent literature information about heavy metal ions and theirs removal methods from aqueous pollutants and wastewater/water, adsorption kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamics models by different type of three dimensional (3D) porous structure. In additional, in this review article, the influence of various parameters such as pH solution, temperature, initial concentration of heavy metal ions, composition, contact time, coexisting ions and adsorbent dosage on the adsorption process of heavy metal ions were investigated.

  abstract = {Membrane fouling is the major problem during the practical application of membrane separation processes in industry and water treatment. Therefore a search for novel efficient methods of membrane cleaning is currently of crucial importance for membrane-based technologies. The paper describes a new method of membrane cleaning, which is based on periodic electrolysis using a novel electrically conductive membrane to remove/prevent membrane fouling. The membrane consists of a thin electrically conductive layer of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) deposited on the membrane׳s surface. The deposited MWCNTs allow the membrane to function as a cathode in an electrochemical system that includes the electrically conductive membrane, the salt water as an electrolyte and a stainless steel counter anode. The efficiency of the cleaning procedure in the flux recovery has been proved with typical bio- and inorganic membrane foulants such as CaCO3 and yeast suspensions. The cleaning mechanism during the electrolysis process is explained by the evolution of gases forming micro-bubbles at the membrane surface which remove the foulant material out from the membrane. The proposed method enables in situ membrane self-cleaning, thus providing a non-destructive, continuous and renewable approach for the mitigation of the different types of membrane fouling.},

The maximum possible water recovery is indicated by the solution concentration at which the supersaturation level triggers an immediate copious precipitation process. The procedure for evaluating a lower scaling threshold limit, at which precipitation is prevented or at least delayed for a sufficiently long period of time, is based on induction time experiments. These are carried out by operating the RO system in a full recycle mode (both permeate and concentrate recycled to the feed vessel) and measuring the time required for the onset of scaling. Results of preliminary tests show that induction time data are well correlated with the supersaturation level according to a relationship based on nucleation theory. Surface energies for CaSO4 nucleation on RO membranes are found to conform with literature data, thus lending support to the proposed induction time technique.},

  abstract = {High-performance thermal insulating materials are desired especially from the viewpoint of saving energy for a sustainable society. Aerogel is the long-awaited material for extended applications due to its excellent thermal insulating ability. These materials are, however, seriously fragile against even small mechanical stress due to their low density, and their poor mechanical properties inhibit their practical use as superinsulators. In this paper, we report relationships between the thermal conductivity, pore size and mechanical properties of organic--inorganic hybrid polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ) aerogels with improved mechanical properties and controllable pore sizes from {$\sim$}50 nm to 3 {$\mu$}m. The dependency of thermal conductivity on gas pressure and pore properties can be well explained by the thermal conduction theory of porous materials. These PMSQ aerogels show improved mechanical properties due to their elastic networks, which enable easier handling compared to conventional aerogels and facile production by simple ambient pressure drying. An aerogel-like ``xerogel'' monolithic panel has been successfully prepared via ambient pressure drying, which shows a low thermal conductivity (0.015 W m-1 K-1) comparable with those of the corresponding PMSQ aerogel and conventional silica aerogels. These results would open the gate for practical applications of these porous materials.},

Firstly, the nanoscale heat transfer characteristics inside aerogel material was introduced. Secondly, the existing models and methods to calculate the thermal conductivity of each heat transfer mode at the nanoscale were reviewed. Next, the advances and developments of the effective thermal conductivity models for the nanoporous silica aerogel materials as well as its composite insulation material were also discussed. Then the procedure of establishing the effective thermal conductivity model of the aerogel insulation material from nanoscale to macroscale was introduced by taking our previous work as an illustration. Finally, it should be noted that for the nanoporous silica aerogel insulation material, there are still some key issues that need to be investigated to get deep understanding of the mechanism of nanoscale heat transfer inside the material, such as the coupled heat transfer behavior at the gas--solid contact interface, the influence of scale effect/interfacial effect on the thermal conductivity of nanoscale solid particles, etc. Thus it is necessary to keep on investigating these questions thoroughly to provide help for establishing more accurate heat transfer model as well as optimizing the insulation performance of the material.},

Results showed that the PEI-GO solid adsorbents were successfully fabricated and the particles were uniform, controllable and intact.

We present a multiphysics-informed deep neural network machine learning method for estimating space-dependent hydraulic conductivity, hydraulic head, and concentration fields from sparse measurements. In this approach, we employ individual deep neural networks (DNNs) to approximate the unknown parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) and states (e.g., hydraulic head and concentration) of a physical system. Next, we jointly train these DNNs by minimizing the loss function that consists of the governing equations residuals in addition to the error with respect to measurement data. We apply this approach to assimilate conductivity, hydraulic head, and concentration measurements for the joint inversion of these parameter and states in a steady-state advection-dispersion problem. We study the accuracy of the proposed data assimilation approach with respect to the data size (i.e., the number of measured variables and the number of measurements of each variable), DNN size, and the complexity of the parameter field. We demonstrate that the physics-informed DNNs are significantly more accurate than the standard data-driven DNNs, especially when the training set consists of sparse data. We also show that the accuracy of parameter estimation increases as more different multiphysics variables are inverted jointly.},

In this approach, K(x), hydraulic head, and concentration fields are approximated with deep neural networks (DNNs). We assume that K(x) is given by its values on a grid, and we use these values to train the K DNN. The head and concentration DNNs are trained by minimizing the residuals of the flow equation and ADE and using the initial and boundary conditions as additional constraints. The PINN method is applied to one- and two-dimensional forward ADEs, where its performance for various Peclet numbers (Pe) is compared with the analytical and numerical solutions. We find that the PINN method is accurate with errors of less than 1\% and outperforms some conventional discretization-based methods for large Pe. Next, we demonstrate that the PINN method remains accurate for the backward ADEs, with the relative errors in most cases staying under 5\% compared to the reference concentration field. Finally, we show that when available, the concentration measurements can be easily incorporated in the PINN method and significantly improve (by more than 50\% in the considered cases) the accuracy of the PINN solution of the backward ADE.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) whether of the DCMD (direct contact membrane distillation) or VMD (vacuum membrane distillation) variety can have a role to play in desalting highly saline waters that have considerable osmotic pressures where reverse osmosis (RO) operation becomes more expensive and problematic. Using MD in this way would allow increased recovery and help reduce the problem of concentrate disposal vexing inland desalination. To realize this promise, MD must show itself to be more resistant to scaling than RO and thus not limited by it in the way that RO is. An analysis of the scaling potential in hollow fiber membrane-based crossflow DCMD is presented in terms of the saturation index profiles throughout the hollow fiber membrane module as a function of the location in the module for the sparingly soluble salt, CaSO4, in various forms (such as, gypsum and anhydrite). Modeling shows that the highest scaling potential is to be found at the high temperature end of the module both due to the high brine temperature and concentration polarization associated with high local fluxes. Concentration effects are far more important than temperature, although concentration polarization estimated in crossflow hollow fiber DCMD units is lower than that in spiral wound modules in RO for similar flux values. Experimental results at high saturation indices on the calcium sulfate system ranging between 1.13 and 1.93 show that despite evidence that calcium sulfate precipitates at elevated temperatures, no significant loss in water vapor permeation is observed. Possible explanations for this resistance to scaling are presented and discussed.},

Here, we report a process for producing composite membranes that comprise crystalline porous organic cage films fabricated by interfacial synthesis on a polyacrylonitrile support. These membranes exhibit ultrafast solvent permeance and high rejection of organic dyes with molecular weights over 600\,g\,mol-1. The crystalline cage film is dynamic, and its pore aperture can be switched in methanol to generate larger pores that provide increased methanol permeance and higher molecular weight cut-offs (1,400\,g\,mol-1). By varying the water/methanol ratio, the film can be switched between two phases that have different selectivities, such that a single, `smart' crystalline membrane can perform graded molecular sieving. We exemplify this by separating three organic dyes in a single-stage, single-membrane process.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the frame-invariance (and the lack thereof) exhibited in simulated anisotropic elasto-plastic responses generated from supervised machine learning of classical multi-layer and informed-graph-based neural networks, and proposes different remedies to fix this drawback. The inherent hierarchical relations among physical quantities and state variables in an elasto-plasticity model are first represented as informed, directed graphs, where three variations of the graph are tested. While feed-forward neural networks are used to train path-independent constitutive relations (e.g., elasticity), recurrent neural networks are used to replicate responses that depends on the deformation history, i.e. or path dependent. In dealing with the objectivity deficiency, we use the spectral form to represent tensors and, subsequently, three metrics, the Euclidean distance between the Euler Angles, the distance from the identity matrix, and geodesic on the unit sphere in Lie algebra, can be employed to constitute objective functions for the supervised machine learning. In this, the aim is to minimize the measured distance between the true and the predicted 3D rotation entities. Following this, we conduct numerical experiments on how these metrics, which are theoretically equivalent, may lead to differences in the efficiency of the supervised machine learning as well as the accuracy and robustness of the resultant models. Neural network models trained with tensors represented in component form for a given Cartesian coordinate system are used as a benchmark. Our numerical tests show that, even given the same amount of information and data, the quality of the anisotropic elasto-plasticity model is highly sensitive to the way tensors are represented and measured. The results reveal that using a loss function based on geodesic on the unit sphere in Lie algebra together with an informed, directed graph yield significantly more accurate rotation prediction than the other tested approaches.

More specifically, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations are conducted in idealized 3-D geometries that resemble the microstructure of a nanofiber membrane. The SPC/E molecular model and coarse-grain Pea model are considered to simulate, respectively, water molecules and air. The fibers, on the other hand, are constructed as simple metal lattice, and their contact angle with water is controlled using a scaling factor from the Lorentz--Berthelot mixing parameters. A proof-of-concept study is presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the new modeling approach in predicting the effects of the membrane's microstructural properties on the desalination performance. While the simulations are conducted at scales 3--4 orders of magnitudes smaller than an actual electrospun membrane, the conclusions can be applied membranes with more practical dimensions.},

One example is the water and even oil-repellent cuticle of springtails (Collembola). The wingless arthropods evolved a highly textured, hierarchically arranged surface pattern that affords mechanical robustness and wetting resistance even at elevated hydrostatic pressures. Springtail cuticle-derived surfaces therefore promise to overcome limitations of lotus-inspired surfaces (low durability, insufficient repellence of low surface tension liquids). In this review, we report on the liquid-repellent natural surfaces of arthropods living in aqueous or temporarily flooded habitats including water-walking insects or water spiders. In particular, we focus on springtails presenting an overview on the cuticular morphology and chemistry and their biological relevance. Based on the obtained liquid repellence of a variety of liquids with remarkable efficiency, the review provides general design criteria for robust omniphobic surfaces. In particular, the resistance against complete wetting and the mechanical stability strongly both depend on the topographical features of the nano- and micropatterned surface. The current understanding of the underlying principles and approaches to their technological implementation are summarized and discussed.},

  abstract = {Springtails (Collembola) are wingless arthropods adapted to cutaneous respiration in temporarily rain-flooded habitats. They immediately form a plastron, protecting them against suffocation upon immersion into water and even low-surface-tension liquids such as alkanes. Recent experimental studies revealed a high-pressure resistance of such plastrons against collapse. In this work, skin sections of Orthonychiurus stachianus are studied by transmission electron microscopy. The micrographs reveal cavity side-wall profiles with characteristic overhangs. These were fitted by polynomials to allow access for analytical and numerical calculations of the breakthrough pressure, that is, the barrier against plastron collapse. Furthermore, model profiles with well-defined geometries were used to set the obtained results into context and to develop a general design principle for the most robust surface structures. Our results indicate the decisive role of the sectional profile of overhanging structures to form a robust heterogeneous wetting state for low-surface-tension liquids that enables the omniphobicity. Furthermore, the design principles of mushroom and serif T structures pave the way for omniphobic surfaces with a high-pressure resistance irrespective of solid surface chemistry.},

It was found that the rapid coagulation rate does depend on the magnetic flux density and the duration of magnetic exposure, even though the magnetic flux density is not high, and that the degree of the magnetic effect depends on the particle size and ions in the medium. It is especially interesting to find that the magnetic effect remains for at least 143 h after the magnetic exposure is completed. It is postulated that these effects are mainly attributable to some alteration of the structure of water molecules and ions adsorbed on the particle surface with the magnetic exposure.},

PINNs are known to be robust for smaller training sets, derive better generalization problems, and are faster to train. In this paper, we show that using PINNs in comparison with purely data-driven neural networks is not only favorable for training performance but allows us to extract significant information on the quality of the approximated solution. Assuming that the underlying differential equation for the PINN training is an ordinary differential equation, we derive a rigorous upper limit on the PINN prediction error. This bound is applicable even for input data not included in the training phase and without any prior knowledge about the true solution. Therefore, our a posteriori error estimation is an essential step to certify the PINN. We apply our error estimator exemplarily to two academic toy problems, whereof one falls in the category of model-predictive control and thereby shows the practical use of the derived results.},

Supersaturation has been proven to be the major driving force of scale formation, but the solubility of calcium sulphate changes with temperature. The main purpose of this work is to investigate the effects of temperature on the formation of calcium sulphate scales in pipes, using a pipe flow system. Various levels of supersaturation of the calcium sulphate solution have been employed at different temperatures. Results indicated that higher temperature produced a large increase of scale amounts and a significant decrease of induction periods. Many forms of hydrated calcium sulphate were created at high temperature. The relationship between deposited scale mass and temperature was deduced from experimental data. From the relationship between induction period and temperature activation energies of the surface nucleation were estimated to be in the range of 42 to 48 kJ mol(-1). (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The influence of the thickness of silica gel layer on the penetration rate of selected liquids and, in consequence, on the value of surface free energy components determined by thin layer wicking method was studied. Plates of the following gel thickness were used: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mm. Measurements of the penetration rate of apolar liquids, i.e. three alkanes: octane, nonane and decane, diiodomethane, alpha-bromonaphthalene and two polar liquids: water and formamide were made for this purpose. From the obtained relationships x(2) = f(t) the suitability of Washburn's equation in the whole penetration range (9 cm) was confirmed for all thicknesses of porous layers. However, the penetration rate of probe liquids changed with the thickness of the deposited layer, it was mainly dependent on an effective (apparent) radius of the interparticle pores. Using these results and the appropriate form of Washburn's equation surface free energy components of silica gel 60 (for four thicknesses of layer) were calculated. It was found that values of apolar Lifshitz-van der Waals (gamma(s)(LW) = 41.7 +/- 0.9 mJm(-2)) and polar acid-base (gamma(s)(AB) = 11.5 +/- 0.5 mJm(-2)): electron donor (gamma(s)(-) = 50.8 +/- 0.9 mJm(-2)) and electron acceptor (gamma(s)(+) = 0.7 +/- 0.1 mJm(-2)) components of surface free energy were very similar for different layer thicknesses. Even in the case of a 2 mm thick layer reproducible values of both Lifshitz-van der Waals and acid-base component were obtained. It is important when the thin layers are prepared in laboratory conditions, i. e. from suspensions by water evaporating, and the deposited layer is of less controlled thickness. When diiodomethane and alpha-bromonaphthalene are considered as weakly polar liquids, the value of Lifshitz-van der Waals component of silica gel is very close to gamma(s)(LW) s determined from n-alkanes.},

  abstract = {Permeability and its anisotropy are of central importance for groundwater and hydrocarbon migration. Existing fluid dynamics methods for computing permeability have common shortcomings, i.e., high computational complexity and long computational time, reducing the potential of these methods in practical applications. In view of this, a 3D CNN-based approach for rapidly estimating permeability in anisotropic rock is proposed. Using high-resolution X-ray microtomographic images of a sandstone sample, numerous samples of the size of 100-cube voxels were generated firstly by a series of image manipulation techniques. The shrinking and expanding algorithms are employed as the data augmentation methods to strengthen the role of porosity and specific surface area (SSA) since these two parameters are critical to estimate permeability. Afterwards, direct pore-scale modeling with Lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) was utilized to compute the permeabilities in the direction of three coordinate axes and mean permeability as the ground truth. A dataset including 3158 samples for training and 57 samples for testing were obtained. Four 3D CNN models with the same network structure, corresponding to permeabilities in 3 directions and in average, were built and trained. Based on those trained models, the satisfactory predictions of the permeabilities inx-,y-, andz-axis directions and the mean permeability were achieved withR(2)scores of 0.8972, 0.8821, 0.8201, and 0.9155, respectively. Furthermore, those proposed 3D CNN models achieved good generalization ability in predicting the permeability of other samples. The trained model takes only tens of milliseconds on average to predict the permeability of one sample in one axial direction, about 10,000 times faster than LBM. The promising performance clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of 3D CNN-based approach in rapidly estimating permeability in anisotropic rock. This new approach provides an alternative way to calculate permeability with low computing cost, and it has the potential to be extended to the estimation of relative permeability and other properties of rocks.},

However, depending on the application context, MD faces several important technical challenges that would lead to compromised performance or even process failure. These challenges include pore wetting, mineral scaling, and membrane fouling. This review is devoted to providing a state-of-the-art understanding of fundamental mechanisms and mitigation strategies regarding these three challenges. Guided by the fundamental understanding of each membrane failure mechanism, we discuss both operational and material strategies that can potentially address the three technical challenges. In particular, the material strategies involve the development of MD membranes with tailored special wetting properties to impart resistance against different types of membrane failure. Lastly, we also discuss research needs and best practices in future studies to further enhance our ability to overcome technical challenges toward the practical, sustainable, and scalable applications of MD.},

  abstract = {A novel ultrasonic assisted direct contact membrane distillation hybrid process was designed and the effect of ultrasonic irradiation on membrane scaling mitigation during membrane distillation process was investigated. Under ultrasonic irradiation, ultrasonic wave refreshed the liquid-membrane interface continuously and reduced concentration polarization in the boundary layer adjacent to membrane surface simultaneously. Therefore, ultrasonic irradiation could mitigate membrane scaling caused by CaSO4 and prevented the permeate flux decline. Although the ultrasonic irradiation could restrain the crystal size of CaCO3 deposits and clean membrane surface, the experimental results demonstrated that it was not necessary to introduce ultrasonic irradiation into membrane distillation process for CaCO3 membrane scaling mitigation. Due to fast precipitation rate, the concentration of CaCO3 solution would not cause notable permeate flux decline in the absence of ultrasonic irradiation. There would be a gradual permeate flux decline during the concentration process of silica solution because of the formation and deposition of colloidal polysilicic acid on membrane surface.

  abstract = {Aerogel materials possess a wide variety of exceptional properties, hence a striking number of applications have developed for them. Many of the commercial applications of aerogels such as catalysts, thermal insulation, windows, and particle detectors are under development and new applications have been publicized since the ISA4 Conference in 1994: e.g., supercapacitors, insulation for heat storage in automobiles, electrodes for capacitive deionization, etc. More applications are evolving as the scientific and engineering community becomes familiar with the unusual and exceptional physical properties of aerogels. In addition to growing commercial applications of aerogels, there are also scientific and technical applications, as well. This paper discusses a variety of technical applications of aerogels. It reports current technical applications under development for which several types of aerogels are formed in custom sizes and shapes. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

This is why the MD approach still cannot successfully compete with other conventional seawater desalination methods. In this study, both the NaCl solution and real seawater are used as the feed of MD processes to investigate the differences in permeate flux, product water quality and membrane fouling. The results indicate the accumulation rate of membrane scale can be depressed by reducing the degree of polarization if NaCl solution is used as the feeding fluid, however, this kind of depression effect is not so obvious when real seawater is used as the feeding fluid. An ultrasonic cleaning technique is found to be an effective way to restore the flux rate for these MD processes and extend the life span of MD membrane.},

  abstract = {Treatment of circulating cooling water via reverse osmosis for water reuse is attractive. However, the discharge of the concentrated circulating cooling water (CCCW) is still an issue to environment. In this paper, direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) was exploited to treat alkaline CCCW for water reclamation and volume reduction. Results suggested that the alkaline CCCW can be concentrated to achieve high volume concentration factor. DCMD performance decline was primarily due to calcium carbonate (CaCO3) scaling. The CaCO3 deposited on the membrane surface was identified as calcite. Various strategies were adopted to mitigate membrane scaling. Acidization of the CCCW can effectively improve system performance. Additionally, the main scalant transformed from CaCO3 to calcium sulfate (CaSO4) with initial pH decrease. Physical cleaning using deionized water can effectively remove CaSO4 and restore DCMD performance. Compared with commercial antiscalants (sodium polyaspartic acid and amino trimethylene phosphonic acid), EDTA showed excellent scale-inhibition performance. The calcium and magnesium in the CCCW were efficiently pre-removed by chemical softening and ion exchange methods, resulting in improvement of DCMD performance. Given scale inhibition and chemical agent costs, chemical softening was the best strategy to alleviate membrane scaling. Our work suggested that DCMD can be selected as a promising approach for treating the high alkaline CCCW combined with proper strategies to control membrane scaling.},

Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of water vapor condensation in a single nanopore with tunable surface wettability were carried out, and then characteristics and dynamic behaviors of water vapor adsorption and condensation in hydrophobic and hydrophilic nanopores were examined in detail. Simulation results indicated that hydrophilic nanopores had high adsorption capacity, and the capillary pressure was the key for the infiltration or rebound progress of condensate in the hydrophobic nanopore. Based on the semi-infiltrated hydrophobic nanopore-liquid water system, furthermore, capillary pressures of hydrophobic nanopores with different sizes and tunable surface wettability were calculated quantitatively by molecular dynamics simulations.},

However, fabrication and application of these multifunctional aerogel films are still significantly underdeveloped. Herein, we demonstrate a multifunctional aerogel film composed of strong aramid nanofibers (ANFs), conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and hydrophobic fluorocarbon (FC) resin. The obtained hybrid aerogel film exhibits large specific surface area (232.8 m2{$\cdot$}g--1), high electrical conductivity (230 S{$\cdot$}m--1), and excellent hydrophobicity (contact angle of up to 137.0{$^\circ$}) with exceptional Joule heating performance and supreme electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding efficiency. The FC coating renders the hydrophilic ANF/CNT aerogel films hydrophobic, resulting in an excellent self-cleaning performance. The high electrical conductivity enables a low-voltage-driven Joule heating property and an EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of 54.4 dB in the X-band at a thickness of 568 {$\mu$}m. The specific EMI SE is up to 33528.3 dB{$\cdot$}cm2{$\cdot$}g--1, which is among the highest values of typical metal-, conducting-polymer-, or carbon-based composites. This multifunctional aerogel film holds great promise for smart garments, electromagnetic wave shielding, and personal thermal management systems.},

In this study, an anti-scaling membrane was developed with a liquid-like surface coating. This fabrication approach combined electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane with surface fluorination without the addition of nanoparticles. Two fluoro silanes with the same alkyl-chain length but different hydrolysis reaction sites were investigated as the fluorination agents. Membrane characterizations indicated that surface modifi\- cation with the single hydrolysis site fluoro silane (17-FAS-S) did not change the membrane morphology or structure. On the other hand, surface modification with the triple hydrolysis site fluoro silane (17-FAS-T) generated nanoparticles on the membrane surface, resulting in increased roughness. While both the 17-FAS-S and 17-FAS-T modified membranes exhibited excellent scaling resistance in the MD scaling tests, the 17-FAS-S membrane provided a much higher vapor flux than the 17-FAS-T one. Finally, the mechanism of scaling resis\- tance and vapor permeability provided by the liquid-like modification was discussed.},

Furthermore, this random self-assembly of GO nanosheets gives rise to a hierarchical micro/nanoscale rough structure on the membrane surface. Along with the crosslinking reaction, PEI was grafted onto the GO nanosheets to make them hydrophilic. Combining the hydrophilic surface chemistry with the micro/nanoscale hierarchical surface structure, the non-laminated GO membrane exhibited the desired superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic properties. We have tested the membrane to separate a series of surfactant-free and surfactant-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions. A high separation efficiency ({$>$}99\%) and flux were achieved using only gravity without any extra power, much larger than commercial filtration membranes with similar permeation properties.

However, ceramic membranes are hydrophilic in nature; hence, membrane surface modification process is required to acquire hydrophobic properties for MD applications. Direct grafting using silane agents is the most widely used ceramic membrane hydrophobization method. Hence, this mini review provides a complete summary of the research progress on the preparation and characterization of the hydrophobic ceramic membranes through silane agent grafting, as well as their applications in MD.

Although MD has shown its ability to treat high salinity waters, membrane fouling is still one of the major issues that limit the long-term stability of MD. In this paper, we report the reduction in scaling during microwave induced membrane distillation (MIMD), where the feed water is heated by microwave irradiation instead of conventional thermal heaters. MD was carried out using a carbon nanotube immobilized membrane using highly concentrated aqueous calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate and barium sulfate solutions, and it was observed that the decline in flux over time was significantly less in MIMD. As compared to conventional heating, the salt deposition on the membrane was 50--79\% less during microwave heating. Scanning electron microscopy analysis also showed that the morphologies of the deposited salts from MIMD were different from those from conventional MD. The decrease in scale formation was also confirmed by dynamic light scattering studies which showed that microwave heating formed smaller particles than those               via               conventional heating. The study clearly demonstrated that MIMD not only generated a higher flux, but also had significantly less fouling with the inorganic scalants studied here.},

  abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme Jor a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from ,files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools .for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

  abstract = {Water scarcity is one of the major issues that has put economic growth, societal stability, and ecosystem balance unstable. Wastewater reuse has been recognised as a viable method for securing potable water supply. Due to its inherent advantages over pressure-driven and energy-intensive reverse osmosis (RO), forward osmosis (FO) is one of the most researched technologies for wastewater reuse applications. However, the draw solution (DS) regeneration stage is one of the key bottlenecks of the process. Membrane distillation (MD), on the other hand, is an emerging technology that could provide a cost-effective thermally-driven purification process, especially when combined with waste heat or solar thermal. Nevertheless, the MD process also has several drawbacks, such as membrane pore wetting. The MD process can effectively regenerate the FO draw solution and produce high-quality water when integrated with the FO process. Within the hybrid process, the FO membrane removes the contaminants from the feed solution and the MD process is only used to regenerate the DS with no significant membrane wetting. It is, therefore, important to study the integrated FO-MD process to overcome the limitations of individual membrane processes. Integrated FO-MD economics, process design, and modelling of different applications are thoroughly reviewed in this contribution. Future research directions and prospects for scale-up are suggested.},

In this paper, rigorous theoretical investigations of the AGMD and LGMD processes were performed with a flat sheet type module using a composite membrane comprised of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) active layer and a polypropylene (PP) support layer. The model predictions were verified by comparing with measured data, where good agreement between the prediction results and experimental data was obtained. It was observed that as the gap size increased the AGMD permeate flux decreased exponentially with increased diffusion resistance. On the other hand, the LGMD permeate flux decreased exponentially and then increased asymptotically after attaining a minimum at a certain liquid-gap size (5--7\,mm). This phenomenon was due to the onset and enhancement of a natural convection, resulting in an improvement in heat and mass transfer in the liquid gap.},

Our findings suggest that current H100 GPUs with 80 GiB of HBM enabled with 512 GiB of tensor offloading capacity allows scaling to 11T-parameter LLMs; and getting to 128T parameters requires 120 GiB of HBM and 2 TiB of offloading memory, yielding 75\%+ MFU, which is uncommon even when training much smaller LLMs today.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) for water treatment is significantly impaired by the scaling of dissolved minerals. The type and content of minerals generally measured as total dissolved solids (TDS) in hypersaline brines not only reduce the MD flux but also control the scaling behavior on the membrane surface. The scaling-induced pore blockage further reduces water flux and eventually leads to membrane wetting. The scaling problem is even more pronounced in the treatment of produced water (PW) as it contains 3--7 times higher TDS concentrations, compared to seawater. Theoretically, the necessary conditions for a salt to precipitate can be traced from its solubility product constant and activity of the constituents within the solution. Therefore, a comprehensive thermodynamic model is necessary to represent the electrolyte behavior and to predict the precipitation of different salts in a complex solution like PW. We pursued electrolyte Nonrandom Two Liquid Theory (eNRTL), a state-of-the-art electrolyte model, to address the PW fluid phase equilibria. With a fully parameterized eNRTL model, we predicted salt precipitations in two different PW samples and compared the results against the experimental findings. Furthermore, we forecast the precipitation of salts in response to the change in PW concentration and temperature in the MD operation.},

  abstract = {One of the fundamental problems in biology concerns the method by which a cluster of organisms can regulate the proportion of individuals that perform various roles or modes as if each individual knows a whole situation without a leader. A specific ratio exists in various species at multiple levels from the process of cell differentiation in multicellular organisms to the situation of social dilemma in a group of human beings. This study found a common basis of regulating a collective behavior which is realized by a series of local contacts between individuals. The most essential behavior of individuals in this theory is to change its internal mode through sharing information in contact with others. Our numerical simulations with cellular automata model realize to regulate the ratio of population of individuals who has either two kinds of modes. From the theoretical analysis and numerical calculations, we found that asymmetric properties in local contacts, are essential for adaptive regulation in response to the global information such a group size and whole density. Furthermore, a discrete system is crucial in no-leader groups to realize the flexible regulation, and the critical condition which eliminates overlap with one another (excluded volume effect) also affects the resulting proportion in high density. The foremost advantage of this strategy is that no global information is required for each individual, and only a couple of mode switching can achieve the whole proportion regulation. The simple mechanism say that proportion regulation in well-organized groups in nature can be realized through and limited to local contacts, and has a potential to solve various phenomena that microscopic individuals behaviors connect to macroscopic orderly behaviors.},

  abstract = {An emulsion-templated porous material can be formed by polymerizing the continuous phase of high internal phase Pickering emulsions (HIPEs). Although polymerization is a key step to maintain the pore size and integrity of the final sponge, it lowers the effective specific surface area of the final sponge as the continuous phase makes up at least half of the HIPE's volume. Hence, eliminating the need of polymerization not only eases the material processing but also leads to a greater specific surface area. Here, we report a novel strategy in which none of the emulsion phases require polymerization and is therefore a versatile methodology. For this purpose, several oil-in-water Pickering emulsions were prepared using graphene oxide (GO) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as the stabilizing agents. GO nanosheets are then reduced by mixing the emulsions with an adequate amount of vitamin C as a green reducing agent. Removal of the oil phase via multiple washing and boiling steps results in the formation of the ultimate reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/CNC sponge. The integrity of the structure remains intact and results in the formation of pores that are comparable in size to the droplets because of (i) the strong adhesion of GO and CNC at the oil/water interface in the initial Pickering emulsions and (ii) the strong intermolecular interactions between GO and CNC particles within the water phase. The sponge was then evaluated for its contaminant removal applicability using methylene blue and found to be effective in different water chemistries and outperform previously reported poly(HIPEs) and granular activated carbon. This is the first report on the formation of a polymer-free emulsion-templated sponge, and we believe that this novel nanomaterial paves the road for the fabrication of other emulsion-templated sponges. Although the proposed application in this work is contaminant removal, it could also be utilized in forming electronic devices and sensors because of the incorporation of rGO as a conductive component.},

  abstract = {A novel algorithm for modeling the influence of the host lattice flexibility in molecular dynamics simulations is extended to chain-like molecules and mixtures. This technique, based on a Lowe-Andersen thermostat, maintains the advantages of both simplicity and efficiency. The same diffusivities and other properties of the flexible framework system are reproduced. Advantageously, the computationally demanding flexible host lattice simulations can be avoided. Using this methodology we study the influence of flexibility on diffusion of n-alkanes inside single-walled carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, results are shown for diffusion of two mixtures (methane-helium and ethane-butane). Using these results we investigate the accuracy of theories describing diffusion in the Knudsen regime. For the dynamics in carbon nanotubes the Knudsen diffusivities are much too low. The Smoluchowski model gives better results. Interestingly, the extended Smoluchowski model can reproduce our simulation results obtained with a rigid host lattice. We modify this model to also treat collisions with a flexible interface correctly. As the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient is needed for the theoretical models, we introduce a simple concept to calculate it.},

The present omniphobic surfaces still have the problems of complex fabrication methods, high cost, and being environmentally harmful. To address these challenges, here we report a novel process to design a non-fluorinated, long-term slippery omniphobic surface of candle soot nanoparticles with a silicone binder that cures at room temperature. The porosity, nanoscale roughness, strong affinity of the substrate with the silicone lubricant, and retention of lubricant after curing of the binder play an important role in its stability and low ice adhesion strength at sub-zero temperature. The developed surface exhibits damage resistant slippery properties, repellency to several liquids with different surface tensions including blood, delay in freezing point along with ultra-low ice adhesion strength (2 kPa) and maintains it even below 7 kPa under harsh environmental conditions; 90 frosting/defrosting cycles at -90 degrees C; 2 months under an ice layer; 2 months at 60 degrees C; 9 days flow in acidic/basic water and exposure to super-cold water. In addition, this novel technique is cheap, easy to fabricate, environmentally benign and suitable for large-scale applications.},

Of the MD configurations, VMD can achieve high flux due to the application of vacuum. This paper analyzes operating parameters (vacuum pressure, feed flow rate, and feed concentration) that affect permeate flux in a modified design VMD system vacuum multi-effect membrane distillation (V-MEMD). The study investigated the most suitable operating parameters that would enhance the performance of V-MEMD system at high salinity (1--4 M of NaCl) with a moderate bulk temperature of 60{\r{}}C. The result of this study showed that vacuum pressure is the most influential factor of the selected, and the effect of temperature polarization is more dominant to permeate flux than concentration polarization. Above this, the high-salinity solution can be treated by V-MEMD system because it does not affect the permeate total dissolved solid and flux. A dominant reduction ratio of vapor pressure was observed even at a low ratio of temperature polarization.},

However, a significant challenge in using EFDM for desalination of high-salinity wastewaters is pore wetting induced by scaling. Herein, we designed a firm-pore superhydrophobic fibrous membrane via a facile and scalable electrospinning in combination with dip-coating methods, which displayed a high-water flux of about 28.5 L/m2{$\cdot$}h ({$\Delta$}T = 40 {\textopenbullet}C) and unexpected durability ({$>$}312 h) in the long-term running of direct contact membrane distillation. Significantly, we also systematically investigate the effect of surface wettability and pore structure on the durability of EFDM. The experiments and simulations demonstrate that the formation of firmpore among the EFDM has a substantial influence on the membrane durability when desalinating high salinity wastewaters, owing to the avoidance of pore deformation influenced by the feedwaters turbulent on the EFDM surface. Meanwhile, the superhydrophobic surface also helps reducing the contact area between the crystals and the salts to further improve the membrane durability. The theory simulation may provide new insight into designing novel structured fibrous membrane to improve the fibrous membrane stability in MD.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) via hydrophobic membranes is a highly effective technology for recovering pure water from hypersaline solutions. However, organic fouling and mineral scaling are two prominent challenges faced by membranes when used for practical applications. Commonly, fouling- and scaling-resistance require hydrophilic and superhydrophobic modification of MD membrane, respectively, which seems contradictory to realize both. Therefore, literature rarely report to address both issues to facilitate MD process. Herein, a membrane with an asymmetric superwetting Janus structure, including a thin superhydrophilic coating on a superhydrophobic bulk membrane, was constructed. The coating layer, based on alginate, alleviated fouling and scaling due to the superhydrophilicity and mineral precipitation resistance, while the underlayered polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane provided robust hydrophobicity, enabling a successful MD process without the membrane being exposed to water. The coated PTFE membrane with the superwetting Janus structure exhibited much higher and more stable vapor flux than the pristine PTFE membrane in the MD process for the treatment of both oil- and solvent-contaminated seawater. Importantly, the coating imparted a high scaling resistance to the PTFE membrane during long-term MD operation for seawater desalination, thereby producing a water vapor flux six times that of the pristine PTFE membrane. The anti-scaling mechanism of the asymmetric superwetting Janus structure has also been proposed as a charge and hydration effect from the coating layer. This study may provide a promising strategy for the design of fouling- and scaling-resistant membrane materials and structures.},

Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane coated with carbon nanotube (CNT) was adopted as the electrically conductive membrane. The biofouling formation on the pre-treatment membrane was systematically analyzed, and the results showed that both operation modes had obvious inhabitation on bacteria, especially the capacitor mode exhibited stronger prevention capability on biomass accumulation than resistor mode. NMDs analysis of microbial communities further revealed that the anti-biofouling effect mainly occurred on the membrane surface, and gram-positive biomarkers which can survive better in external electric field was distinctively found in capacitor mode through LEfSE analysis. Hypothesis was introduced to explain the anti-fouling function of two modes that in the capacitor mode, the competitive electrostatic repulsion of bacteria cells on negative electrode associated by the cell-disruption effect of electro-catalyzed reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, while the anti-fouling function of resistor mode was a result of temperature increment on membrane surface caused by Joule heating effects.

In this study, an electrically conductive membrane was fabricated by coating a PTFE membrane with graphene layer, and an electric-enhanced direct contact membrane distillation system (EE-DCMD) was developed subsequently. Systematical analysis showed that the EE-DCMD system exhibited a simultaneous anti-wetting and flux-enhancing property, which overcome the tradeoff between wetting resistance and water vapor permeability. A mechanistic insight into such excellent perfor\- mance was proposed from the aspects of electrochemical oxidation, in-situ electro-flotation, and electrostatic repulsion. More specifically, the effect of the in-situ electro-flotation was quantified using a mechanical model based on the Gibbs adsorption equation, showing advantages over the conventional flotation pretreatment. Furthermore, an XDLVO theory coupled with a modified-Poisson-Boltzmann equation (MPB) was used to quantify the interaction energy between foulants and the charged membrane. We believe that the electrically conductive membrane has a promising potential in treating saline water with complex composition, and the proposed mechanism will pave the way for the smart design of the EE-DCMD like systems.},

For solar steam generation, the primary focus is to design new materials that are biodegradable, sustainable, of low cost, and have high solar steam generation efficiency. Here, we designed a bilayer aerogel structure employing naturally abundant cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) as basic building blocks to achieve sustainability and biodegradability as well as employing a carbon nanotube (CNT) layer for efficient solar utilization with over 97.5\% of light absorbance from 300 to 1200 nm wavelength. The ultralow density (0.0096 g/cm3) of the aerogel ensures that minimal material is required, reducing the production cost while at the same time satisfying the water transport and thermal-insulation requirements due to its highly porous structure (99.4\% porosity). Owing to its rationally designed structure and thermal-regulation performance, the bilayer CNF--CNT aerogel exhibits a high solar-energy conversion efficiency of 76.3\% and 1.11 kg m--2 h--1 at 1 kW m--2 (1 Sun) solar irradiation, comparable or even higher than most of the reported solar steam generation devices. Therefore, the all-nanofiber aerogel presents a new route for designing biodegradable, sustainable, and scalable solar steam generation devices with superb performance.},

Graphene and its derivatives are one such promising material. Graphene is a 2D material, which exhibits remarkable strength and durability, has a very high specific surface area, is easily modified and has high thermal and electrical conductivity. As a result, it is a candidate material for a remarkable range of desalination applications, including in membranes for separation processes, direct solar thermal desalination and electrolytic desalination processes. This review paper describes the background and properties of interest for desalination processes and reviews the recent literature for graphene compounds used in membrane processes (including reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, forward osmosis, membrane distillation, pervapouration, electrodialysis), capacitive deionisation and solar desalination. Overall, high permeability combined with high salt rejection compared with conventional materials for these applications, suggest that these materials could potentially revolutionise desalination if they can be produced at commercial scales at competitive costs.},

  abstract = {Solidification is one of the oldest processes for producing complex shapes for applications ranging from art to industry, and remains as one of the most important commercial processes for many materials. Since the 1980s, numerous fundamental developments in the understanding of solidification processes and microstructure formation have come from both analytical theories and the application of computational techniques using commonly available powerful computers. This book integrates these developments in a comprehensive volume that also presents and places them in the context of more classical theories. This second edition highlights the key concepts within each chapter to help guide the reader through the most important aspects of the topics. The figures are now in color, in order to improve the visualization of phenomena and concepts. Recent important developments in the field since the first edition was published have also been added. The three-part text is aimed at graduate and professional engineers. The first part, Fundamentals and Macroscale Phenomena, presents the thermodynamics of solutions and then builds on that subject to motivate and describe equilibrium phase diagrams. Transport phenomena are discussed next, focusing on the issues of most importance to liquid-solid phase transformations, then moving on to describing in detail both analytical and numerical approaches to solving such problems. The second part, Microstructure, employs these fundamental concepts for the treatment of nucleation, dendritic growth, microsegregation, eutectic and peritectic solidification, and microstructure competition. This part concludes with a chapter describing the coupling of macro- and microscopic phenomena in microstructure development. The third and final part describes various types of Defects that may occur, with emphasis on porosity, hot tearing and macrosegregation, presented using the modeling tools and microstructure descriptions developed earlier.},

  abstract = {Until our knowledge of the disposition and motion of the electrons in atoms and molecules is more complete, we cannot hope to make a direct calculation of the nature of the forces called into play during an encounter between molecules in a gas. It is true that a step in this direction has recently been made by Debye, who has investigated the nature of the field in the neighbourood of a hydrogen atom, assumed to consist of a negative charge in motion in circular orbit about a positive nucleus, and has shown how the pulsating eld gives rise on the whole to a force of repulsion, as well as one of attraction n a unit negative charge. But it is difficult to see how this work can be extended to more complex systems. At present we can only hope to derive information by more indirect methods. One such method is to assume a definite law of force, and then by the methods of the kinetic theory to deduce the appropriate law of dependence of the viscosity of a gas on temperature. Comparison with the actual law, as observed experimentally, serves to support or discredit the assumed law of molecular interaction. Unfortunately, the calculations involved in the application of be kinetic theory are so complicated that progress has been made only in certain simple cases. Thus, the original investigation by Maxwell applied only to molecules repelling as the inverse fifth power law. His work has since be generalised by Chapman and Enskog and formul{\ae} have been obtained: the coefficient of viscosity in the case of (i) molecules, which repel according an inverse nth power law, (ii) molecules which behave on collision like rig elastic spheres and (iii) molecules which behave as rigid elastic spheres with weak attractive field of force surrounding them. Of these models the la generally referred to as Sutherland's model, is found to give the best agreement between theory and experiment. But the agreement is by no means perfe As Schmidt, Bestelmeyer, Vogel, and others have pointed out, there considerable divergence from observed values a t low temperatures.},

  abstract = {The investigation of a preceding paper has shown that the temperature variation of viscosity, as determined experimentally, can be satisfactorily explained in many gases on the assumption that the repulsive and attractive parts of the molecular field are each according to an inverse power of the distance. In some cases, in argon, for example, it was further shown that the experimental facts can be explained by more than one molecular model, from which we inferred that viscosity results alone are insufficient to determine precisely the nature of molecular fields. The object of the present paper is to ascertain whether a molecular model of the same type will also explain available experimental data concerning the equation of state of a gas, and if so, whether the results so obtained, when taken in conjunction with those obtained from viscosity, will definitely fix the molecular field. Such an investigation is made possible by the elaborate analysis by Kamerlingh Onnes of the observational material. He has expressed the results in the form of an empirical equation of state of the type pv = A + B/v + C/v2 + D/v4 + E/v6 + F/v8, where the coefficients A ... F, called by him virial coefficients, are determined as functions of the temperature to fit the observations. Now it is possible by various methods to obtain a theoretical expression for B as a function of the temperature and a strict comparison can then be made between theory and experiment. Unfortunately the solution for B, although applicable to any molecular model of spherical symmetry, is purely formal and contains an integral which can be evaluated only in special cases. This has been done up to now for only two simple models, viz., a van der Waals molecule, and a molecule repelling according to an inverse power law (without attraction), but it is shown in this paper that it can also be evaluated in the case of the model, which was successful in explaining viscosity results. As the two other models just mentioned are particular cases of this, the appropriate formul{\ae} for B are easily deduced from the general one given here.},

  abstract = {Classical Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out for liquid water in the NPT ensemble at 25\,{$^\circ$}C and 1 atm using six of the simpler intermolecular potential functions for the water dimer: Bernal--Fowler (BF), SPC, ST2, TIPS2, TIP3P, and TIP4P. Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18\% overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen--oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self-diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint.},

  abstract = {Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) --- deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95\% of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X -- 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X -- 80X higher. Moreover, using the CPU's GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.},

  abstract = {Seawater membrane distillation (SWMD) is a promising separation technology due to its ability to operate as a stand-alone desalination unit operation. This paper reviews approaches to improve laboratory-to-pilot-scale MD performance, which comprise operational strategies, module design, and specifically tailored membranes. A detailed comparison of SWMD and sea water reverse osmosis is presented to further analyze the critical shortcomings of SWMD. The unique features of SWMD, namely the ability to operate with extremely high salt rejection and at extreme feed concentration, highlight the SWMD potential to be operated under zero liquid discharge (ZLD) conditions, which results in the production of high-purity water and simultaneous salt recovery, as well as the elimination of the brine disposal cost. However, technical challenges, such as thermal energy requirements, inefficient heat transfer and integration, low water recovery factors, and lack of studies on real-case valuable-salt recovery, are impeding the commercialization of ZLD SWMD. This review highlights the possibility of applying selected strategies to push forward ZLD SWMD commercialization. Suggestions are projected to include intermittent removal of valuable salts, in-depth study on the robustness of novel membranes, module and configuration, utilization of a low-cost heat exchanger, and capital cost reduction in a renewable-energy-integrated SWMD plant.},

  abstract = {CONSPECTUS: In meeting the increasing need for clean water in both developing and developed countries and in rural and urban communities, photothermal membrane water treatment technologies provide outstanding advantages: For developing countries and rural communities, by utilizing sunlight, photothermal membrane water treatment provides inexpensive, convenient, modular, decentralized, and accessible ways to clean water, which can reduce the consumption of conventional energy (e.g., electricity, natural gas) and the cost of clean water production. In developed countries and urban communities, photothermal membrane water treatment can improve the energy efficiency during water purification. In these water purification processes, the light absorption and light-to-heat conversion of photothermal materials are important factors in determining the membrane efficacy. Nanomaterials with well-controlled structure and optical properties can increase the light absorption and photothermal conversion of newly developed membranes. This Account introduces our recent work on developing scalable, cost-effective, and highly efficient photothermal membranes for four water purification applications: reverse osmosis (RO), ultrafiltration (UF), solar steam generation (SSG), and photothermal membrane distillation (PMD). By utilizing photothermal materials, first, we have demonstrated how sunlight can be used to improve the membrane's resistance to biofouling in RO and UF processes by photothermally induced inactivation of microorganisms. Second, we have developed novel SSG membranes (i.e., interfacial evaporators) that can harvest solar energy, convert it to localized heat, and generate clean water by evaporation. This desalination approach is particularly useful and promising for treatment of highly saline water. These new interfacial evaporators utilized graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and polydopamine (PDA). The solar conversion efficiency and environmental sustainability of the interfacial evaporators were optimized via (i) novel and versatile bottom-up biofabrication (e.g., incorporation of photothermal materials during bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) growth) and (ii) easy and cost-effective top-down preparation (e.g., modification of natural wood with photothermal materials). Third, we have developed membranes for PMD that incorporate photothermal materials to generate heat under solar irradiation, thus providing a higher transmembrane temperature difference and higher driving force for effective vapor transport, making the membrane distillation process more energy-efficient. Lastly, this Account compares the photothermal membrane applications, summarizes current challenges for photothermal membrane applications, and offers future directions to facilitate the translation of photothermal membranes from the laboratory to large engineered systems by improving their scalability, stability, and sustainability.},

For inverse modeling, the framework estimates the heterogeneous coefficients, given an input of pressure and/or displacement fields, with a relative r.m.s.e. of less than 7\%, even for cases where the input data are incomplete and contaminated by noise. The framework also provides a speed-up of 120,000 times compared to a Gaussian prior-based inverse modeling approach while also delivering more accurate results.},

  abstract = {Natural convection in porous media is a highly nonlinear multiphysical problem relevant to many engineering applications (e.g., the process of CO2 sequestration). Here, we extend and present a non-intrusive reduced order model of natural convection in porous media employing deep convolutional autoencoders for the compression and reconstruction and either radial basis function (RBF) interpolation or artificial neural networks (ANNs) for mapping parameters of partial differential equations (PDEs) on the corresponding nonlinear manifolds. To benchmark our approach, we also describe linear compression and reconstruction processes relying on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and ANNs. We present comprehensive comparisons among different models through three benchmark problems. The reduced order models, linear and nonlinear approaches, are much faster than the finite element model, obtaining a maximum speed-up of 7 x 10(6) because our framework is not bound by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition; hence, it could deliver quantities of interest at any given time contrary to the finite element model. Our model's accuracy still lies within a relative error of 7\% in the worst-case scenario. We illustrate that, in specific settings, the nonlinear approach outperforms its linear counterpart and vice versa. We hypothesize that a visual comparison between principal component analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) could indicate which method will perform better prior to employing any specific compression strategy.},

  abstract = {Accounting for the morphology of shale formations, which represent highly heterogeneous porous media, is a difficult problem. Although two- or three-dimensional images of such formations may be obtained and analyzed, they either do not capture the nanoscale features of the porous media, or they are too small to be an accurate representative of the media, or both. Increasing the resolution of such images is also costly. While high-resolution images may be used to train a deep-learning network in order to increase the quality of low-resolution images, an important obstacle is the lack of a large number of images for the training, as the accuracy of the network's predictions depends on the extent of the training data. Generating a large number of high-resolution images by experimental means is, however, very time consuming and costly, hence limiting the application of deep-learning algorithms to such an important class of problems. To address the issue we propose a novel hybrid algorithm by which a stochastic reconstruction method is used to generate a large number of plausible images of a shale formation, using very few input images at very low cost, and then train a deep-learning convolutional network by the stochastic realizations. We refer to the method as hybrid stochastic deep-learning (HSDL) algorithm. The results indicate promising improvement in the quality of the images, the accuracy of which is confirmed by visual, as well as quantitative comparison between several of their statistical properties. The results are also compared with those obtained by the regular deep learning algorithm without using an enriched and large dataset for training, as well as with those generated by bicubic interpolation.

  abstract = {Flow, transport, mechanical, and fracture properties of porous media depend on their morphology and are usually estimated by experimental and/or computational methods. The precision of the computational approaches depends on the accuracy of the model that represents the morphology. If high accuracy is required, the computations and even experiments can be quite time-consuming. At the same time, linking the morphology directly to the permeability, as well as other important flow and transport properties, has been a long-standing problem. In this paper, we develop a new network that utilizes a deep learning (DL) algorithm to link the morphology of porous media to their permeability. The network is neither a purely traditional artificial neural network (ANN), nor is it a purely DL algorithm, but, rather, it is a hybrid of both. The input data include three-dimensional images of sandstones, hundreds of their stochastic realizations generated by a reconstruction method, and synthetic unconsolidated porous media produced by a Boolean method. To develop the network, we first extract important features of the images using a DL algorithm and then feed them to an ANN to estimate the permeabilities. We demonstrate that the network is successfully trained, such that it can develop accurate correlations between the morphology of porous media and their effective permeability. The high accuracy of the network is demonstrated by its predictions for the permeability of a variety of porous media.},

However, during this process a rapid membrane fouling and permeate flux decline was observed when the tap water was used as a feed. The precipitation of deposit in the modules was limited by the separation of sparingly soluble salts from the feed water in the nanofiltration. The combined reverse osmosis---membrane distillation process prevented the formation of salt deposits on the membranes employed for the membrane distillation. Ultrafiltration was found to be very effective removing trace amounts of oil from the feed water. Then the ultrafiltration permeate was used for feeding of the remaining membrane modules resulting in the total removal of oil residue contamination. The ultrafiltration allowed producing process water directly from the industrial effluents containing petroleum derivatives.},

The precipitation of CaCO3 on the membrane surface and a rapid flux decline was observed when tap water was used directly as a feed. The problem of scaling was eliminated by the acidification of the feed to pH = 4 and stable module efficiency was observed. The performance of the MD module was significantly improved when tap water was subjected to softening in NF process. The precipitation of the silica compounds during the operation of MD process with the NF permeate was found. These compounds caused clogging of the capillary membrane inlets, resulting in a gradual decline of the module efficiency. The application of filtration net assembled at the module inlet prevented blocking of the capillary membrane inlets. The MD process can be run without a flux decline, associated with the scaling, when the pH of NF permeate was adjusted at a level of 4. A partial wettability of the membrane resulting in a flux decline by 30\% was observed after 1100 h of process duration. The quality of obtained distillate was stable and practically independent of the feed concentration.

  abstract = {Membrane distillation is an emerging water distillation technology that offers several advantages compared to conventional water desalination processes. Although progress has been made to model and understand the physics of the process, many studies are based on steady-state assumptions or are computationally not appropriate for real time control. This paper presents the derivation of a novel dynamical model, based on analogy between electrical and thermal systems, for direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). The proposed model captures the dynamics of temperature distribution and distilled water flux. To demonstrate the adequacy of the proposed model, validation with transient and steady-state experimental data is presented.},

We used controlled interfacial polymerization to form free-standing polyamide nanofilms less than 10 nanometers in thickness, and incorporated them as separating layers in composite membranes. Manipulation of nanofilm morphology by control of interfacial reaction conditions enabled the creation of smooth or crumpled textures; the nanofilms were sufficiently rigid that the crumpled textures could withstand pressurized filtration, resulting in increased permeable area. Composite membranes comprising crumpled nanofilms on alumina supports provided high retention of solutes, with acetonitrile permeances up to 112 liters per square meter per hour per bar. This is more than two orders of magnitude higher than permeances of commercially available membranes with equivalent solute retention.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is an emerging thermal desalination process, which can potentially treat high salinity industrial wastewaters, such as shale gas produced water and power plant blowdown. The performance of MD systems is hampered by inorganic scaling, particularly when treating hypersaline industrial wastewaters with high-scaling potential. In this study, we developed a scaling-resistant MD membrane with an engineered ``slippery'' surface for desalination of high-salinity industrial wastewaters at high water recovery. A polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was grafted with silica nanoparticles, followed by coating with fluoroalkylsilane to lower the membrane surface energy. Contact angle measurements revealed the ``slippery'' nature of the modified PVDF membrane. We evaluated the desalination performance of the surface-engineered PVDF membrane in direct contact membrane distillation using a synthetic wastewater with high gypsum scaling potential as well as a brine from a power plant blowdown. Results show that gypsum scaling is substantially delayed on the developed slippery surface. Compared to the pristine PVDF membrane, the modified PVDF membranes exhibited a stable MD performance with reduced scaling potential, demonstrating its potential to achieve high water recovery in treatment of high-salinity industrial wastewaters. We conclude with a discussion of the mechanism for gypsum scaling inhibition by the engineered slippery surface.},

For this purpose, the feed water was passed through an intensive magnetic field and then introduced to the membrane module. The experiments were carried out for 80 h at different feed temperatures and flow rates, and different magnetic field intensities to ensure the effectiveness of the method. The best location for applying the magnetic field was determined, experimentally. In the absence of the magnetic field, a flux decline of about 50\% was observed during 80 h of operation, while by applying three pairs of magnets, a 20\% increase in the permeate flux and 72\% decrease in the product TDS was observed. By increasing the magnetic field intensity, the size and the amount of the scale particles formed in the bulk solution increased but the analysis revealed that the scale build-up on the membrane surface was decreased upon applying the magnetic field. The process was optimized by the RSM method for obtaining the operating condition for attaining the best performance of the membrane system. At this optimum condition, an average permeate flux of 3.06 L/ m2.h was obtained.},

  abstract = {Nucleation, the initial process in vapor condensation, crystal nucleation, melting, and boiling, is the localized emergence of a distinct thermodynamic phase at the nanoscale that macroscopically grows in size with the attachment of growth units. These phase changes are the result of atomistic events driven by thermal fluctuations. The occurrence of atomistic level events with the length scales on the order of 10-10 m and time scales of 10-13 S equivalent to the vibrational frequency of atoms makes the nucleation a very complicated phenomenon to study. Even though abundant literature is available about fundamental aspects of nucleation, the knowledge on these phenomena is far from complete. The classical pathway to nucleation which was once considered to have general applicability to all nucleating systems is gradually giving way to a nonclassical pathway which is now considered as a dominating mechanism in solution crystallization and other systems. In this review, an attempt is made to compare underlying physical principles involved in various nucleating systems and their theoretical treatment based on classical nucleation theory, and other important theories such as a density functional approach and diffuse interface theory. The limitations of classical theory, the gradual evolution of a nonclassical two-step pathway to nucleation, and the questions that have to be addressed in the future are discussed systematically.},

To study how different inlet velocities and temperatures affect mass flux and temperature polarisation, a 3-D CFD model using ANSYS CFX was developed and tested. The membrane was assumed fully permeable and heat and mass transfer through the membrane were modelled by implementing FORTRAN user-subroutines. This approach allowed studying how heat transfer by convection through the membrane affects the temperature profiles. Three hydrodynamic angles were tested: {$\alpha$}f = 45{$^\circ$}, {$\alpha$}f = 90{$^\circ$} and {$\alpha$}f = 0{$^\circ$}. From the simulations, it was found that the optimal configuration producing the highest mid-membrane temperature Tm and temperature polarisation coefficient {$\Theta$}, was when the hydrodynamic angle {$\alpha$}f = 45{$^\circ$}. This was further corroborated by experimental results carried out on a flat plate membrane distillation module, that produced the highest flux (100.33 kg/m2{$\cdot$}h) when the system was operating with a hydrodynamic angle {$\alpha$}f = 45{$^\circ$}. The least desirable configuration was found to be when the hydrodynamic angle {$\alpha$}f = 0{$^\circ$}, as this produced the lowest mid-membrane temperature and lowest temperature polarisation coefficient.},

Water contact angle analysis did not show significant change in hydrophilicity of TFC and unmodified PVDF membranes while the liquid entry pressure of water (LEPw) for TFC membrane increased significantly due to formation of ZIF-8/chitosan layer on the PVDF membrane surface. As a result of air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) tests, the permeate water flux increased about 350\% after formation of ultrathin ZIF-8/chitosan layer on PVDF membrane surface compared to the unmodified PVDF membrane under filtration of saline water (3.5\,wt\% NaCl). Surprisingly, ZIF-8/chitosan modified membrane showed higher NaCl rejection of {$>$}99.5. The antifouling properties of the membranes were also investigated. The TFC membrane presented better antifouling property when real seawater was used as feed solution by flux reduction of 16\% and flux recovery of 90\% compared with flux reduction of 41\% and flux recovery of 67\% for the neat PVDF membrane. Moreover, the stability of TFC was investigated by molecular dynamic simulation. Interaction energy computation and diffusion coefficient calculation confirmed good compatibility of ZIF-8 network with chitosan chain and good performance of the TFC membrane in case of water vapor flux.},

  abstract = {A hierarchically assembled superomniphobic membrane with three levels of reentrant structure was designed and fabricated to enable effective treatment of low surface tension, hypersaline oily wastewaters using direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). The overall structure is a combination of macro corrugations obtained by surface imprinting, with the micro spherulites morphology achieved through the applied phase inversion method and nano patterns obtained by fluorinated Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) coating. This resulted in a superomniphobic membrane surface with remarkable anti-wetting properties repelling both high surface tension water and low surface tension oils. Measurements of contact angle (CA) with DI water, an anionic surfactant, oil, and ethanol demonstrated a robust wetting resistance against low surface tension liquids showing both superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity. CA values of 160.8~{\textpm}~2.3{$^\circ$} and 154.3~{\textpm}~1.9{$^\circ$} for water and oil were obtained, respectively. Calculations revealed a high liquid-vapor interface for the fabricated membrane with more than 89\% of the water droplet contact area being with air pockets entrapped between adjacent SiNPs and only 11\% come into contact with the solid membrane surface. Moreover, the high liquid-vapor interface imparts the membrane with high liquid repellency, self-cleaning and slippery effects, characterized by a minimum droplet-membrane interaction and complete water droplet bouncing on the surface within only 18~ms. When tested in DCMD with synthetic hypersaline oily wastewaters, the fabricated superomniphobic membrane demonstrated stable, non-wetting MD operation over 24~h, even at high concentrations of low surface tension 1.0~mM Sodium dodecyl sulfate and 400~ppm oil, potentially offering a sustainable option for treatment of low surface tension oily industrial wastewater.},

  abstract = {An experimental based artificial neural network (ANN) model is constructed to describe the performance of air gap membrane distillation process for different operating conditions. The air gap thickness, the condensation temperature, the feed inlet temperature, and the feed flow rate of salt aqueous solutions are the input variables of this process, whereas the response is the performance index, which takes into consideration both the permeate flux and the salt rejection factor. The neural network approach was found to be capable for modeling accurately this membrane distillation configuration. The overall agreement between the ANN predictions and experimental data was very good showing a correlation coefficient of 0.992. To test the statistical significance of the developed ANN model the analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been employed. According to ANOVA test, the ANN model is found to be statistically valid and can be used for the prediction of the performance index. Finally, the predictive abilities of the ANN model were ascertained by plotting the 3D generalization graphs. The optimum operating condition was determined by Monte Carlo stochastic method and the obtained optimal conditions are 3.0 mm air gap thickness, 13.9 {$^\circ$}C condensation temperature, 71 {$^\circ$}C feed inlet temperature and 205 L/h feed flow rate with a maximum experimental performance index of 51.075 kg/m2 h and a residual error less than 1\%.},

  abstract = {Sweeping gas membrane distillation process (SGMD) has been used for desalination and its performance index, defined as the product of the distillate flux and the salt rejection factor, has been modeled using artificial neural network (ANN) methodology. A feed-forward ANN has been developed for prediction of the performance index based on a set of 53 different experimental SGMD tests. A feed solution of 30 g/L sodium chloride was used in all experiments and the salt rejection factors were found to be greater than 99.4\%. The individual and interaction effects of the input variables, namely the feed inlet temperature, the feed flow rate or the feed circulation velocity, and the air flow rate or the air circulation velocity, on the SGMD performance index have been investigated. The optimum point was determined by means of Monte Carlo simulation. The obtained optimal conditions were a feed inlet temperature of 69 {$^\circ$}C, an air flow rate of 34.5 L/min (i.e. 2.02 m/s air circulation velocity) and a feed flow rate of 160 L/h (i.e. 0.155 m/s liquid circulation velocity). Under these operating conditions a performance index of 1.493 {\texttimes}10-3 kg/m2.s has been achieved experimentally being the maximal SGMD performance index obtained inside the region of experimentation.},

Combined effects of polymer and additive (polyethylene glycol, PEG) concentrations in the casting solutions, solvent evaporation time and coagulation bath temperature on the structural characteristics of the prepared membranes as well as on their direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) performance have been investigated using statistical approach. The morphological properties of the membranes have been studied in terms of scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and void volume fraction. The factorial linear models have been developed to describe the main effects of factors on the DCMD responses namely, pure water permeation flux, permeate flux when using salt solution and salt rejection coefficient of the prepared membranes. Analysis of variance showed that all factors have significant effects on the responses. However, the coagulation bath temperature is the least influential factor, while the PVDF-HFP concentration has the greatest effects on both the permeate flux and the salt rejection coefficient. Optimization of membrane preparation conditions has been carried out using a minimum number of experiments and applying Lagrange multipliers optimization method. Under the obtained optimum conditions, 19.1 wt.\% PVDF-HFP concentration, 4.99 wt.\% PEG concentration, 35 degrees C coagulation bath temperature and 102 s solvent evaporation time, the prepared membrane exhibits the highest salt rejection coefficient, 99.95\%, with a permeate flux of 4.41 L/h m(2).

An abrupt increase in the number of papers on MD membrane engineering (i.e. design, fabrication and testing in MD) is seen since only 6years ago. The present paper offers a comprehensive MD state-of-the-art review covering a wide range of commercial membranes, MD membrane engineering, their MD performance, transport mechanisms, experimental and theoretical modeling of different MD configurations as well as recent developments in MD. Improved MD membranes with specific morphology, micro- and nano-structures are highly demanded. Membranes with different pore sizes, porosities, thicknesses and materials as well as novel structures are required in order to carry out systematic MD studies for better understanding mass transport in different MD configurations, thereby improving the MD performance and looking for MD industrialization.},

Dispersed and confusing water production costs (WPC) and specific energy consumption (EC) analysis were reported. Most of them are simulated and others are based on various costs assumptions. At present, the common asked questions about the published papers in MD including EC and WPC are: how these reported calculations on WPC and EC were made?, what is the current WPC of MD?, and how WPC of MD can be improved?. An overview of most studies carried out on these issues is presented and some useful equations and information in this context are reported. Comparison to other separation processes used in desalination is made. At present, the main challenge for large-scale MD is EC and WPC. New directions on MD should be raised. More rigorous investigations and focused directions on economical analysis of MD systems should be conducted. A unified standard method for analysis and calculations should be followed to determine WPC. For the benefit of MD process, one should be cautious when reporting simulated, non-realistic and non-contrasted WPC. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

An incident light microscopy setup was used to monitor crystal growth on the membrane in the feed channel. An image processing strategy called Digitally Simulated Dark Field Illumination helped overcome the extremely low contrast between translucent crystals and the membrane surface. Further image processing and statistical evaluation enabled us to quantitatively track the population of crystals on the membrane. Simultaneously, membrane wetting was monitored using tracer-based Laser Induced Fluorescence. This allowed us to locate membrane leakages. The combination of these two experimental techniques gave insight into the coupling mechanisms of scaling and membrane wetting in Vacuum Membrane Distillation, where classical methods for wetting detection could not be applied. The methodology was tested with different scalants under process conditions to rate its performance and identify limitations.},

We investigated the effect of the length scale and hierarchy of the surface topography of the underlying substrates on their ability to retain the lubricant under high shear conditions, which is important for maintaining nonwetting properties under application-relevant conditions. By comparing the lubricant loss, contact angle hysteresis, and sliding angles for water and ethanol droplets on flat, microscale, nanoscale, and hierarchically textured surfaces subjected to various spinning rates (from 100 to 10 000 rpm), we show that lubricant-infused textured surfaces with uniform nanofeatures provide the most shear-tolerant liquid-repellent behavior, unlike lotus leaf-inspired superhydrophobic surfaces, which generally favor hierarchical structures for improved pressure stability and low contact angle hysteresis. On the basis of these findings, we present generalized, low-cost, and scalable methods to manufacture uniform or regionally patterned nanotextured coatings on arbitrary materials and complex shapes. After functionalization and lubrication, these coatings show robust, shear-tolerant omniphobic behavior, transparency, and nonfouling properties against highly contaminating media.},

  abstract = {Ice-repellent coatings can have significant impact on global energy savings and improving safety in many infrastructures, transportation, and cooling systems. Recent efforts for developing ice-phobic surfaces have been mostly devoted to utilizing lotus-leaf-inspired superhydrophobic surfaces, yet these surfaces fail in high-humidity conditions due to water condensation and frost formation and even lead to increased ice adhesion due to a large surface area. We report a radically different type of ice-repellent material based on slippery, liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS), where a stable, ultrasmooth, low-hysteresis lubricant overlayer is maintained by infusing a water-immiscible liquid into a nanostructured surface chemically functionalized to have a high affinity to the infiltrated liquid and lock it in place. We develop a direct fabrication method of SLIPS on industrially relevant metals, particularly aluminum, one of the most widely used lightweight structural materials. We demonstrate that SLIPS-coated Al surfaces not only suppress ice/frost accretion by effectively removing condensed moisture but also exhibit at least an order of magnitude lower ice adhesion than state-of-the-art materials. On the basis of a theoretical analysis followed by extensive icing/deicing experiments, we discuss special advantages of SLIPS as ice-repellent surfaces: highly reduced sliding droplet sizes resulting from the extremely low contact angle hysteresis. We show that our surfaces remain essentially frost-free in which any conventional materials accumulate ice. These results indicate that SLIPS is a promising candidate for developing robust anti-icing materials for broad applications, such as refrigeration, aviation, roofs, wires, outdoor signs, railings, and wind turbines.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Using the fact that the cosine of these contact angles for both surfaces are inversely proportional to the radius of the droplet contact surface (rdr(Z0)), the contact angle {\texttheta}{$\infty$} of the macroscopic water droplet was obtained by extrapolating cos {\texttheta} to 1/rdr(Z0) = 0. The estimated values of {\texttheta}{$\infty$} on the crystal and amorphous surfaces were 96{$^\circ$} and 86{$^\circ$}, respectively, showing that the amorphous surface is less hydrophobic than the crystal surface. The contact angle of the crystalline/amorphous mixed surface was estimated using the Cassie equation to be 91{$^\circ$}. This value agrees well with experimental measurement of the water contact angle on the PVDF film. Furthermore, the interaction energy, interface structure, and electrostatic potential were analyzed to clarify the reason for the lower hydrophobicity of the amorphous surface. This surface interacts more favorably with water than the crystal surface. Such an interaction reduces the excess free energy (interfacial tension) at the PVDF and water interface and makes the amorphous surface less hydrophobic. The amorphous interfacial region contains more water molecules than the crystal one, and water molecules are oriented toward the PVDF. This interface structure makes water strongly interact with the PVDF.},

In the model, the strength of a floe is expressed as a product of the cohesive force between primary particles and the number of contacts between clusters in the floc. To confirm the validity of this model, three types of polystyrene latex flocs with different fractal dimensions were broken up in the turbulent flow generated with a Rushton type agitator in a mixing vessel. The relation of the maximum diameter of the floe vs the turbulent shear stress was confirmed to obey the scaling law predicted by the proposed model. The power of the relation was also consistent with theoretical prediction. {\copyright} 1999 American Chemical Society.},

Calcium carbonate was precipitated by CO2 removal. The increase in the temperature or the solution pH leads to the acceleration of calcium carbonate nucleation and crystal growth. Iron addition retards the formation of calcium carbonate crystals and enhanced the precipitation in the bulk solution. At high supersaturations, the inhibition effectiveness of iron is small and it could be improved by lowering the solution pH. The results of the present work show that it is possible to reduce or completely prevent scale formation in different water treatment processes by controlling the operating parameters which favourably affects the water treatment costs, increases the equipment life and allows increased product water recovery.},

Such surfaces have a range of commercial applications, including self-cleaning, non-fouling, stain-free clothing, drag reduction, corrosion prevention and separation of liquids. Such surfaces have thus generated immense academic and industrial interest in recent years. In this review, we discuss the systematic design of superomniphobic surfaces. In particular, we discuss the significance of surface energy, roughness and the critical role of re-entrant texture in obtaining the so-called Cassie-Baxter state with low surface tension liquids. We also discuss how hierarchical scales of texture can yield high contact angles and decrease the contact angle hysteresis of superomniphobic surfaces by reducing the solid-liquid contact area. On the basis of this understanding, we discuss dimensionless design parameters that allow for the systematic design of superomniphobic surfaces. We also review the current literature on superomniphobic surfaces, paying particular attention to surfaces that demonstrate good mechanical, chemical and radiation durability-traits that are essential for any commercial application of superomniphobic surfaces. Finally, we conclude by identifying the unresolved challenges in the fabrication of durable superomniphobic surfaces and highlight the future needs in the field.},

Initially, a report of the air filtration models to fibrous filter media will be presented along with an explanation of both the parameters and the physical quantities which govern the air filtration process. Furthermore, the resulting equation from the mathematical model will be applied to a real filter medium and the characteristic curves of filter efficiency will be drawn. The change of a filter medium efficiency with regard to the Reynolds number of air flow that passes through the filter, derived from the curves, will be studied. The general conclusion that we have is that as the Reynolds number of filtered air increases, the collection efficiency of the filter decreases.},

The rate of biofilm development on the membranes was investigated including the effect of the fibers' position in the module (next to entrance and next to exit). In most of the experiments there was little or no drop in flux when operated at 40{$^\circ$}C with cross flow DCMD. However, under these conditions, SEM images show the presence of microorganisms on the membranes. The fibers placed at the entrance of the module were less fouled compared to membranes near the exit of the module and this most likely reflects the difference in temperature between entrance and exit.

Key parameters, including concentration polarization coefficient (CPC), temperature polarization coefficient (TPC), mass flux, and module pressure drop, are evaluated to analyze flux performance and membrane wetting implications. The CFD simulations are conducted on a three-dimensional domain for each design with representative membrane properties. The Reynolds numbers evaluated are 500 and 1500. Contour plots are provided to gain insight into the flow-field characteristics. Stream-wise profiles and average values are provided as a means to compare the design performance. The results indicate that adding either net-type spacers or membrane corrugation to the feed channel provides performance enhancement over an empty channel design. It is found that both the net-type spacer concept and the corrugated membrane offer better flux performance over the baseline design (49\% - 60\% for the net-type spacers and 62\% - 67\% flux enhancement for the corrugated membrane), reduced concentration polarization coefficient (51\% for the Re = 500 case and 45\% for the Re = 1500 case for spacers and 58\% for the Re = 500 case and 49\% for the Re = 1500 case for corrugation), increased TPC (2\% - 3\% higher), and increased wall shear stress over the baseline design. The most significant finding is that the corrugated membrane design accomplishes the listed performance improvement while yielding five times less pressure drop increase than the net-type spacer design.},

The contact angle of water on such flat solids is typically of the order of 100 to 120{$^\circ$}, but reaches values as high as 160 to 175{$^\circ$} if they are rough3,4,5 or microtextured6,7,9,10. This result is remarkable because such behaviour cannot be generated by surface chemistry alone. Two distinct hypotheses are classically proposed to explain this effect. On one hand, roughness increases the surface area of the solid, which geometrically enhances hydrophobicity (Wenzel model)1. On the other hand, air can remain trapped below the drop, which also leads to a superhydrophobic behaviour, because the drop sits partially on air (Cassie model)2. However, it is shown here that both situations are very different from their adhesive properties, because Wenzel drops are found to be highly pinned. In addition, irreversible transitions can be induced between Cassie and Wenzel states, with a loss of the anti-adhesive properties generally associated with superhydrophobicity.},

A high 64{$^\circ$}Brix concentration was achieved. The trans-membrane driving force decreased with increasing extra-fiber temperature but increased with higher feed and distillate flow rates in the intra- and extra-fiber volumes, respectively. Flux inversion was sensitive to small differences in temperature between the intra- and extra-fiber volumes and could be prevented by increasing the intra-fiber feed temperature by 2--4{$^\circ$}C. Flux rates were dependent upon the temperature polarisation coefficient (TPC) and the effect of the concentration polarisation coefficient (CPC) was negligible.

The method consists of growing the crystals of an oriented seed layer to a well-intergrown film by avoiding events that lead to a loss of preferred orientation, such as twin overgrowths and random nucleation. Organic polycations are used as zeolite crystal shape modifiers to enhance relative growth rates along the desirable out-of-plane direction. The polycrystalline films are thin (similar to1 micrometer) with single grains extending along the film thickness and with large in-plane grain size (similar to1 micrometer). The preferred orientation is such that straight channels with an open diameter of similar to5.5 angstroms run down the membrane thickness. Comparison with previously reported membranes shows that these microstructurally optimized films have superior performance for the separation of organic mixtures with components that have small differences in size and shape, such as xylene isomers.},

Nanocomposite poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/nanoclay membranes were prepared by phase inversion and then tested for abrasion resistance. Their material properties were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), tensile testing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Nanoclay Cloisite 15A was utilised as the inorganic nanoparticle incorporated into PVDF. FTIR results showed a shifting of the PVDF crystalline phase from alpha to beta thus indicating that the nanoclay altered the PVDF host material's structure and mechanical properties in terms of stiffness and toughness. Water permeation test showed that nanoday at low concentration tended to reduce water flux. All nanocomposite membranes, with between 1 wt\% and 5 wt\% initial nanoday loading, were more abrasion resistant than the control PVDF membrane. However, the 1 wt\% exhibited superior resistance, lasting two times longer than the reference PVDF membrane under the same abrasive condition. The 1 wt\% nanoclay membrane appeared less abraded by SEM observation, while also having the greatest tensile strength improvement (from 4.5 MPa to 4.9 MPa). This membrane also had the smallest agglomerated nanoclay particle size and highest toughness compared to the higher nanoclay content membranes. Nanodays are therefore useful for improving abrasion resistance of PVDF membranes, but optimal loadings are essential to avoid losing essential mechanical properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The membrane module designed for this work is unique in that it can use flat-sheet membranes without a support. Additionally, the membrane module and associated apparatus were designed to achieve relatively high feed and permeate Reynolds numbers within the module. These two factors led to a dramatic reduction in boundary layer resistances, which resulted in improved VMD fluxes. This paper also examines a new complete VMD model based on the dusty-gas model, which accounts for both Knudsen and viscous mass transport across the membrane.

In this study, we show that Drosophila myosin 1D (Myo1D) and myosin 1C (Myo1C) are sufficient to generate de novo directional twisting of cells, single organs, or the whole body in opposite directions. Directionality lies in the myosins' motor domain and is swappable between Myo1D and Myo1C. In addition, Myo1D drives gliding of actin filaments in circular, counterclockwise paths in vitro. Altogether, our results reveal the molecular motor Myo1D as a chiral determinant that is sufficient to break symmetry at all biological scales through chiral interaction with the actin cytoskeleton.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we report our unexpected finding about the correlation between Lewis acid-base surface interaction components and linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) solvatochromic parameters {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$}. In 1987, van Oss, Chaudhury, and Good proposed to split the asymmetric acid-base parts of a bipolar system into separate surface tension components:\, Lewis acid (electron acceptor) {$\gamma$}+ and Lewis base (electron donor) {$\gamma$}-. It was assumed that the ratio of {$\gamma$}+ and {$\gamma$}- for water at 20 {$^\circ$}C was to be 1.0. With that ratio as a reference, the base components, {$\gamma$}- for other liquids, biopolymers, polymers, and solids appeared to be overestimated. Recently, we unexpectedly found a correlation for liquids between {$\gamma$}+ and {$\gamma$}-, and {$\alpha$} (solvent hydrogen-bond-donating ability) and {$\beta$} (solvent hydrogen-bond-accepting ability) introduced since 1976 by Taft and Kamlet. From that correlation, we obtained a more realistic ratio for the normalized {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} values for water at ambient temperature to be 1.8 instead of 1.0. Based on this new ratio, we calculated total surface tensions for related materials at 20 {$^\circ$}C. They are generally unchanged as expected, despite the considerable, favorable change in the {$\gamma$}+ and {$\gamma$}- values in the direction of lowering the Lewis basicity. The predicability of solubility with interfacial tension is also unaffected. For example, the sign of those negative interfacial tensions that favor solubility remains the same. In addition, the implications of other LSER parameters, e.g. {$\Pi$}* and {$\delta$}H2, on surface properties will be briefly mentioned.},

We first prepared positively charged nanofiber mats by electrospinning a blend polymer--surfactant solution of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) and cationic surfactant (benzyltriethylammonium). Negatively charged silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) were grafted on the positively charged electrospun nanofibers via dip-coating to achieve multilevel re-entrant structures. Grafted SiNPs were then coated with fluoroalkylsilane to lower the surface energy of the membrane. The fabricated membrane showed excellent omniphobicity, as demonstrated by its wetting resistance to various low surface tension liquids, including ethanol with a surface tension of 22.1 mN/m. As a promising application, the prepared omniphobic membrane was tested in direct contact membrane distillation to extract water from highly saline feed solutions containing low surface tension substances, mimicking emerging industrial wastewaters (e.g., from shale gas production). While a control hydrophobic PVDF-HFP nanofiber membrane failed in the desalination/separation process due to low wetting resistance, our fabricated omniphobic membrane exhibited a stable desalination performance for 8 h of operation, successfully demonstrating clean water production from the low surface tension feedwater.},

The examination of scanning electron microscopy of a fouled membrane surface provided strong evidence that there are two mechanisms in NF fouling (e.g., scale formation on the membrane surface) in nanofiltration; surface and bulk crystallization. The hydrodynamic operating conditions determined which fouling mechanism was dominant. The fouling due to surface crystallization augmented with an increase in operating pressure, but reduced with an increase in flow velocity. Concentration polarization was found to be responsible for this type of fouling. On the other hand, the extent of fouling by bulk crystallization appeared to be the most important at intermediate crossflow velocity and higher operating pressure (e.g., higher flux) because both secondary nucleation effect and deposition probability depends on crossflow velocity and permeation rate. An experimental and theoretical method for differentiating one mechanism from another was explored in order to elucidate the dominant fouling mechanism according to the hydrodynamic conditions.},

The nonwetting stability and slip length on the dual-scale micro-nano structures are measured and compared with those on single-scale micro-smooth structures. A force balance between a liquid pressure and a surface tension indicates that hydrophobic nanostructures on the sidewall of microposts or microgrates would expand the range of the nonwetted state. When a higher gas Fraction or a larger pitch can be tested without wetting, a larger slip length is expected on the microstructures. An ideal dual-scale structure is described that isolates the role of the nanostructures, and a fabrication technique is developed to achieve such a microstructure-smooth tops and nanostructured sidewalls. The tests confirm such micro-nano structures allow a nonwetted state at a higher gas fraction or a larger pitch than the previous micro-smooth structures. As a result, we achieve the maximum slip length of similar to 400 mu m on the dual-scale structures, an increase of similar to 100\% over the previous maximum reported on the single-scale (i.e., micro-smooth) structures. The study ameliorates our understanding of the role of each scale on hierarchical structures for a wetting transition and a liquid slip. The resulting giant slip is large enough to influence many fluidic applications, even in macroscale.},

LB and CA were adopted to simulate the diffusion of alloy solute and hydrogen in liquid melt and phase transition during solidification, respectively. Microstructural morphologies including the formation of gas porosity and the growth of solid phase were visualized with different solidification conditions. The simulation results were validated by comparing with experiment data reported in the literature in terms of the percentage of porosity and morphology tendency with respect to the solidification conditions. The pore size decreased when applying the higher cooling rate due to the insufficient growth time. Apparently, the higher initial hydrogen concentration led to the higher percentage of the porosity.

The deformation of microspheres, such as the occurrence of broken microspheres and polymeric strings, became apparent as the concentration of aerogel particles was increased. Consequently, while the pure microsphere-coated membrane showed a 156.7{$^\circ$} contact angle, that of the 30\% aerogel-assisted microsphere-coated membrane was 162.1{$^\circ$}, with a water droplet easily rolling on it. In addition, the 30\% aerogel-assisted microsphere-coated membrane exhibited a high and stable repellency during continuous contact with a relatively low surface tension solution of 3.5\% NaCl containing 0.1\,mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).

  abstract = {A gas in between micro- or nanostructures on a submerged superhydrophobic (SHPo) surface allows the liquid on the structures to flow with an effective slip. If large enough, this slippage may entail a drag reduction appreciable for many flow systems. However, the large discrepancies among the slippage levels reported in the literature have led to a widespread misunderstanding on the drag-reducing ability of SHPo surfaces. Today we know that the amount of slip, generally quantified with a slip length, is mainly determined by the structural features of SHPo surfaces, such as the pitch, solid fraction, and pattern type, and further affected by secondary factors, such as the state of the liquid-gas interface. Reviewing the experimental data of laminar flows in the literature comprehensively and comparing them with the theoretical predictions, we provide a global picture of the liquid slip on structured surfaces to assist in rational design of SHPo surfaces for drag reduction. Because the trapped gas, called plastron, vanishes along with its slippage effect in most application conditions, lastly we discuss the recent efforts to prevent its loss. This review is limited to laminar flows, for which the SHPo drag reduction is reasonably well understood.},

  abstract = {Discontinuous 3D graphene structures in graphene aerogels endow them extremely low density and excellent compression recovery. These types of discontinuous 3D graphene structure can be theoretically considered as continuous 3D curved graphene structures with large defects like holes with free edges. In order to investigate the structural and mechanical properties of graphene aerogels, we use phase-field-crystal method in finite element method scheme and molecular dynamics simulations to build a group of discontinuous curved graphene models based on a group of Schwarz-surface-like graphene models which possess continuous curved graphene structures. The structural and mechanical properties of both the continuous and discontinuous curved graphene models are investigated. It shows that the discontinuous curved graphene structures possess much lower Young's modulus and worse damage-free compression recovery than continuous curved graphene models. This reveals that the mechanical properties of graphene aerogels can be significantly improved by enhancing the structural continuity. Moreover, a shear strengthening mechanism is found in part of the continuous curved graphene models. Considerable shear stresses in these models enhance the stiffness by sacrificing the yielding strength a little. It indicates that the introduction of shear strengthening mechanism by structure design can further tune the mechanical properties of graphene aerogels.},

This work demonstrates the effect of convective heat transfer on common MD performance metrics, reviews existing methods to model and measure convective heat transfer in MD cassettes, and proposes a novel experimental method to validate and or correct estimated convective heat transfer coefficients. This simple method compares trends in experimental permeability to those of theoretical permeability over a series of driving forces and/or flow conditions. We first validate this method using experimental data collected from two cassettes using a single membrane. After correcting the heat transfer coefficients for each cassette, the permeability of a single membrane is consistent across two different cassettes. We then validate this method for a single cassette using two different membranes, finding that the experimentally determined cassette correction factor is consistent within the cassette. Consistent and accurate reporting of cassette heat transfer coefficients will promote direct comparison of membrane and module performance across different MD systems.},

The herein proposed method is based on the application of sodium dodecyl sulfate and hydrogen peroxide, both easily degradable and cheap materials. The polymerization reaction is performed on 24 h time scale under standard conditions. We monitored a polaronic peak at 465 nm and estimated nanoparticle concentration during various stages of the reaction. Using this data we proposed a mechanism for Ppy nanoparticle formation in accordance with earlier emulsion polymerization mechanisms. Rates of various steps in the polymerization mechanism were accounted for and the resulting particles identified using atomic force microscopy. Application of Ppy nanoparticles prepared by the route presented here seems very promising for biomedical applications where biocompatibility is paramount. In addition, this kind of synthesis could be suitable for the development of solar cells, where very pure and low-cost conducting polymers are required.},

Inspired by the desert beetle, a dual-region hydrophobic graphene/hydrophilic titanium dioxide (TiO2) aerogel (GTA) with internal hydrophilic-hydrophobic hybrid wettability structure is prepared via a facile freeze-drying and thermal reduction method. The evaporator shows adjustable wettability, optimized water content, and a low energy loss in the evaporation process. Simultaneously, the hybrid wetting structure in aerogel subjects salt to a dynamic crystallization-dissolution process to prevent salt deposition. The GTA solar evaporator achieves an evaporation rate of 1.52 kg{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}h-1 with a 91.02\% efficiency under 1 sun irradiation. Furthermore, GTAs achieve a stable evaporation rate in high salinity brine (25 wt \% NaCl) under 1 sun irradiation for 100 h, which could compete well with other most advanced photothermal evaporation materials. Moreover, the synergistic effect of graphene and TiO2 endows GTAs with excellent photocatalytic degradation and self-cleaning properties, which can effectively reduce the enrichment of contaminants on the evaporator. Therefore, GTA evaporators can efficiently and stably obtain clean water from seawater and wastewater, which provides a feasible strategy for the purification of complex wastewater.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of the directional thermal conductivity has significant guiding significance for the application of the anisotropic porous media. The prediction of directional thermal conductivity can be achieved with high efficiency by building a machine learning model. However, the traditional prediction methods of porous media thermal conductivity are usually based on image recognition machine learning model, which requires a lot of computing resources and training data, bringing great challenges to machine learning prediction. Therefore, this study proposes to use a parameter based multilayer perceptron model to establish a prediction method from the control parameters of porous media generation to the directional thermal conductivity, to improve the prediction efficiency and prediction accuracy with a small number of data sets. To compare the advantages of the proposed methods, we build three machine learning models for comparison: multilayer perceptron model, lightweight convolutional neural network, and VGG19 convolutional neural network. The results show that for a small number of training data sets, the multilayer perceptron model based on control parameters is superior to the convolutional neural network model based on image prediction. The MRE of the MLP is improved by 2.24 \% compared to the lightweight CNN. In addition, for a limited dataset, the prediction accuracy can be effectively improved by lightweight CNN model, and the MRE is improved by 7.95 \%.},

Photonics offers a promising solution by leveraging the unique properties of light. However, conventional neural network architectures, which typically require dense programmable connections, pose several practical challenges for photonic realizations. To overcome these limitations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate Photonic Neural Cellular Automata (PNCA) for photonic deep learning with sparse connectivity. PNCA harnesses the speed and interconnectivity of photonics, as well as the self-organizing nature of cellular automata through local interactions to achieve robust, reliable, and efficient processing. We utilize linear light interference and parametric nonlinear optics for all-optical computations in a time-multiplexed photonic network to experimentally perform self-organized image classification. We demonstrate binary classification of images in the fashion-MNIST dataset using as few as 3 programmable photonic parameters, achieving an experimental accuracy of 98.0\% with the ability to also recognize out-of-distribution data. The proposed PNCA approach can be adapted to a wide range of existing photonic hardware and provides a compelling alternative to conventional photonic neural networks by maximizing the advantages of light-based computing whilst mitigating their practical challenges. Our results showcase the potential of PNCA in advancing photonic deep learning and highlights a path for next-generation photonic computers.},

Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) can desalt such waters provided the membrane technique is highly resistant to fouling by scaling salts. In DCMD, we had shown earlier that a rectangular cross-flow hollow fiber membrane (HFM) configuration with a specific plasma-polymerized nearly superhydrophobic coating on the membrane ensured no precipitation-based fouling from CaCO3 and CaSO4 for salt concentrations up to 19 wt \%. A novel aspect of this method, oscillation of unrestrained HFMs, is illustrated here. Earlier models simulating desalination performance of such devices assumed membrane mass transfer coefficient, km, as an adjustable parameter for large hollow fiber modules. Here km was predicted from a recent model without any adjustable parameters, resulting in a better module water vapor flux prediction. To improve membrane module performance and productivity, simulations were carried out by varying hollow fiber ID, HFM length, and the distillate flow rate. The simulation results will help design optimum HFM modules for DCMD-based desalination.},

  abstract = {Permeability and selectivity are the two most important parameters in membrane distillation process. The membrane with high porosity and superhydrophobicity could increase the mass transfer coefficient, decrease the heat losses and improve the resistance to wettability. To satisfy this purpose, a novel superhydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAHP)/polystyrene (PS) multi-scale nanofiber membrane (MNM) with high porosity and low thermal conductivity was successfully designed and developed via one-step electrospinning. The formation of multi-scale structures was caused by the addition of TBAHP. PS owns low thermal conductivity and low surface energy which can enhance the thermal efficiency and improve the hydrophobicity of MNMs. Besides, the addition of PS can amplify the classifying effect, construct the nano-micron structure and endow the membrane with superhydrophobicity. The results showed that the thermal conductivity of membranes decreased from 0.03361~W/mK to 0.02777~W/mK and the water contact angle increased from 138.2{$^\circ$} to 151.7{$^\circ$}.

The interfacial forces of pollutants-hydroxide flocs and pollutants-MIEX were 0.46~mN~m-1 and 0.62~mN~m-1. They were 1.24 and 1.68 times greater than the interfacial force of pollutants-membrane, respectively. The synergistic mechanism of K2FeO4 preoxidation and MIEX adsorption in pollutant removal was further elucidated by analyzing the organic matter in the feed water. The K2FeO4-MIEX-UF process enhanced the removal of organics from water. Therefore, the K2FeO4 preoxidation, MIEX adsorption and UF combined process is an effective strategy for reducing membrane fouling in the UF process.},

  abstract = {Solar-driven interfacial evaporation (SIE) is a promising approach for obtaining clean water but suffers from serious salt-fouling and poor long-term performance in seawater. Here, we report a high-performance salt-resistant SIE system from the perspective of nature sustainability. An electrically conductive and magnetic carbon aerogel is prepared by carbonization of Fe3O4modified cellulose that originated from waste paper, and then its external surface is activated using O2-plasma, forming the Janus superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic structure. The superhydrophilic external surface of the aerogel with macroporous skeleton assures ultrafast and adequate water supply and salt diffusion, while the superhydrophobic interior is the thermal insulator hindering water/salt infiltration. Benefiting from high solar absorption ({$\sim$}97\%), low thermal conductivity, unique Janus structure, and photothermal/electrothermal effects, the aerogel shows high evaporation rate (2.1 kg m-2 h-1, 1 sun) for simulated seawater. The aerogel features the following remarkable long-term salt-antifouling performance: (i) {$>$}20 d continuous evaporation in simulated seawater without degradation, even in 10 wt \% NaCl solution, and (ii) {$>$}50 h continuous evaporation without seawater replenishment. Moreover, heavy metal ions, soluble organics, and oil can be completely removed from complex wastewater by the aerogel. This study offers an alternative approach in achieving clean water via SIE of seawater and complex wastewater.},

Benefiting from the utilization of SiO2 NPs with three different particle sizes, the electrospun nanofibrous membranes (ENMs) were endowed with three different delicate nanofiber morphologies and fiber diameter distribution, high porosity, and superhydrophobic property, which resulted in excellent waterproofing and breathability. Significantly, structural attributes analyses have indicated the major contributing role of fiber diameter distribution on determining the augment of permeate vapor flux through regulating mean flow pore size (MFP). Meanwhile, the extremely high liquid entry pressure of water (LEPw, 2.40 +/- 0.10 bar), robust nanofiber morphology of PVDF immobilized SiO2 NPs, remarkable mechanical properties, thermal stability, and corrosion resistance endowed the as-prepared membranes with prominent desalination capability and stability for long-term MD process. The resultant choreographed PVDF/silica ENMs with optimized MFP presented an outstanding permeate vapor flux of 41.1 kg/(m(2).h) and stable low permeate conductivity (similar to 2.45 mu s/cm) (3.5 wt \% NaCl salt feed; Delta T = 40 degrees C) over a DCMD test period of 24 h without membrane pores wetting detected. This result was better than those of typical commercial PVDF membranes and PVDF and modified PVDF ENMs reported so far, suggesting them as promising alternatives for MD applications.},

Its application has been limited by its high operational cost because of the energy consumption required for hydraulic circulation and heating the entire circulating feed. Localized heating of the feed by Joule heating diminishes energy consumption, but the potential charging on the electrothermal material surface causes water splitting and membrane degradation in high-salinity environments. Herein, a novel reverse Joule-heating air gap MD method was designed in which an electrothermal material was placed at the air gap, isolating itself from saline water. Even though the Joule-heating layer was at the air gap side, 90.56\% of heat flowed into the saline water for heating the feed. The opposite temperature gradient in the membrane matrix as opposed to conventional MD-mitigated membrane wetting was caused by capillary condensation. This novel electrothermal-driven MD configuration is worthy to be introduced into applications.},

Herein, we propose an effective strategy to fabricate a superomniphobic MD membrane with excellent wetting/scaling resistance and mechanical robustness. Specifically, a hierarchical re-entrant architecture was created by immobilizing spherical silica nanoparticles onto a poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane surface via covalent bonds, followed by fluorination via thiol--ene click chemistry. An ultrahigh water contact angle (166.5~{\textpm}~1.4{$^\circ$}) and low sliding angle (5.0~{\textpm}~1.1{$^\circ$}) confirmed the superhydrophobicity and slippery characteristics of the modified membrane, which were further illustrated by its excellent wetting resistance toward various liquids with low surface tension. The membrane sustained a long-duration MD for the treatment of a highly saline brine, with a surfactant content of approximately 2.0~mM, outperforming all the MD membranes reported in the exiting literature. In addition, the membrane exhibited excellent desalination performance for synthetic multi-component hypersaline wastewater, achieving a high water recovery ratio of approximately 60\% without a significant decline in water flux. Overall, this study provides a novel and effective approach to fabricate high-performance MD membranes with robust functionality for operations under harsh environments.},

However, graphene aerogels are generally subject to brittle mechanical properties and the irreversible damage of network structures during extreme compressions. Thus, the challenge of finding ways to enhance the strength and resilience of graphene aerogels remains. Herein, superelastic and ultralight aerogels are fabricated through a thermal-treatment of 3D ordered graphene aerogels. The treatments at 400-1000 {$^\circ$}C eliminate most of the oxygen-containing functional groups and enhance the {$\pi$}-{$\pi$} stacking interactions between graphene sheets, forming a well-ordered structure of graphene sheets in cell walls. The aerogels can withstand a loading of 100\,000 N (109 times their own weight) for 60 min and retain their substantial elastic resilience. This loading corresponds to an ultimate compressive stress of approximately 1000 MPa and a strain of 99.8\%, and this ultimate stress is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the values for other (carbon-based, polymer-based, inorganic-based, and metal-based) porous materials. The superelastic properties can be attributed to the graphite-like ordered structure of cell walls. The successful fabrication of such superelastic materials opens a new avenue to explore their potential applications in pressure sensors, mechanical shock absorbers, soft robots, and deformable electronic devices.},

Boundary layer heat transfer resistances in the membrane cell on both sides of the membrane and the two membrane surface temperatures were determined from the experimental data over a range of hot brine and cold distillate flow rates by the Wilson plot technique. Membrane properties such as the maximum pore size and tortuosity were characterized and employed in checking out model assumptions and model results for water vapor transport in the Knudsen regime and the transition region. Good agreements (within 5\% deviation) of the membrane mass transfer coefficient of water vapor and the observed water vapor fluxes were obtained between the experimental values and the simulated results predicted for either the Knudsen regime or the transition region.},

Owing to their intrinsic porous characteristics, unique chemical versatility and abundant functionalities, MOFs have received substantial attention for diverse industrial applications, including membrane separation. Exciting research activities ranging from fabrication strategies to separation applications of MOF-based membranes have appeared. Inspired by the marvelous achievements of MOF-based membranes in gas separations, liquid separations are also being explored for the purpose of constructing continuous MOFs membranes or MOF-based mixed matrix membranes. Although these are in an emerging stage of vigorous development, most efforts are directed towards improving the liquid separation efficiency with well-designed MOF-based membranes. Therefore, as an increasing trend in membrane separation, the field of MOF-based membranes for liquid separation is highlighted in this review. The criteria for judicious selection of MOFs in fabricating MOF-based membranes are given. Special attention is paid to rational design strategies for MOF-based membranes, along with the latest application progress in the area of liquid separations, such as pervaporation, water treatment, and organic solvent nanofiltration. Moreover, some attractive dual-function applications of MOF-based membranes in the removal of micropollutants, degradation, and antibacterial activity are also reviewed. Finally, we define the remaining challenges and future opportunities in this field. This Tutorial Review provides an overview and outlook for MOF-based membranes for liquid separations. Further development of MOF-based membranes for liquid separation must consider the demands of strict separation standards and environmental safety for industrial application.},

We processed a typical ternary saturated solution (Na+/Mg2+//Cl---H2O) with MDC to investigate the influence of different Na+/Mg2+ ratios on membrane distillation permeation flux and crystal morphology from the perspective of experiment and molecular dynamics simulation. From the simulation results, it was demonstrated that increasing magnesium ions could modify the hydration structure of the cations and influence the diffusion coefficient of the hydrated ions in the solution. The reduced free water and diffusion ability led to the changes in permeation flux and crystal morphology. The crystals with different morphologies could be produced by adjusting the ratio of Na+/Mg2+ and MDC temperature.

  abstract = {Membranes with low thermal conductivity for membrane distillation (MD) can decrease heat conduction and improve thermal efficiency, which is important for MD applications. Silica aerogel (SiAG) was employed for blending with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to fabricate PVDF-SiAG insulating membranes in this study. The effects of SiAG addition on membrane characteristics and heat transfer during MD testing were investigated. The addition of SiAG resulted in an increase in mean pore size and thickness. Total thermal conductivity of the membrane decreased from 0.111 to 0.083 W/(m{$\cdot$}K). Theoretical calculation and modeling illustrated that the thermal conductivity of the membrane material (mixture of PVDF and SiAG) decreased from 0.190 to 0.135 W/ (m{$\cdot$}K) because of low thermal conductivity of SiAG. For MD testing, permeate flux increased by 50\% as did latent heat, and the conduction of heat decreased from 19.68 to 10.90 kW/m2. The thermal efficiency increased from 22.01\% to 42.81\%. Permeate flux kept stable and salt rejection was higher than 99.99\% during 24-h-MD test. The PVDF-SiAG insulating membranes improved thermal efficiency remarkably and have a great potential for industrial applications of MD.},

  abstract = {In order to reduce the wetting and fouling propensity of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane during coking wastewater treatment by membrane distillation, two kinds of omniphobic PVDF composite membranes were prepared by coating SiO2 nanoparticles on PVDF membrane surface via electrostatic adsorption or chemical bonding respectively, and subsequently fluorination. The coated SiO2 nanoparticles observed as amounts of nano-scale protrusions by scanning electron microscope constructed a re-entrant structure and enhanced membrane surface roughness. The omniphobicity of the modified membranes was confirmed by high contact angles ({$>$}\,150{$^\circ$}) for water, diiodomethane and ethylene glycol on the membrane surface. The omniphobic layer with SiO2 nanoparticles coated via chemical bonding was more stable than electrostatic adsorption. Both the omniphobic PVDF membranes exhibited stable and high rejections of the inorganic and organic contaminants, which were determined by conductivity, total organic carbon and three-dimensional excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy of the distillate. The modified omniphobic membranes also showed much less flux decline than the pristine PVDF membrane in direct contact membrane distillation tests (120\,h), suggesting their excellent anti-fouling performance. This study indicates that coating silica nanoparticles via chemical bonding is an effective and promising method to fabricate omniphobic PVDF membrane for coking wastewater treatment.},

A prerequisite for exploiting most proposed applications for graphene is the availability of processable graphene sheets in large quantities. The direct dispersion of hydrophobic graphite or graphene sheets in water without the assistance of dispersing agents has generally been considered to be an insurmountable challenge. Here we report that chemically converted graphene sheets obtained from graphite can readily form stable aqueous colloids through electrostatic stabilization. This discovery has enabled us to develop a facile approach to large-scale production of aqueous graphene dispersions without the need for polymeric or surfactant stabilizers. Our findings make it possible to process graphene materials using low-cost solution processing techniques, opening up enormous opportunities to use this unique carbon nanostructure for many technological applications.},

When physical testbeds are not available we frequently turn to simulation for evaluation. Unfortunately, existing simulators are insufficient for end-to-end evaluation, as they either cannot simulate all components, or simulate them with inadequate detail.We address this through modular simulation, flexibly combining and connecting multiple existing simulators for different components, including processor and memory, devices, and network, into virtual end-to-end testbeds tuned for each use-case. Our architecture, SimBricks, combines well-defined component interfaces for extensibility and modularity, efficient communication channels for local and distributed simulation, and a co-designed efficient synchronization mechanism for accurate timing across simulators. We demonstrate SimBricks scales to 1000 simulated hosts, each running a full software stack including Linux, and that it can simulate testbeds with existing NIC and switch RTL implementations. We also reproduce key findings from prior work in congestion control, NIC architecture, and in-network computing in SimBricks.},

The interlayer spacing of the GO nanosheets was increased by the insertion of PVA, and good mechanical integrity was attained by the cross-linked structure. They showed excellent continuous flow adsorption capacity (CFAC) when methylene blue (MB) was used as a model contaminant; a water flux of 396 L{$\cdot$}m--2{$\cdot$}h--1 through a 2 cm thick adsorbent sponge was achieved at a hydraulic head of only 10 cm water, with an almost complete retention of MB. They corresponded to a water permeability of 4.0 {\texttimes} 105 L{$\cdot$}m--2{$\cdot$}h--1{$\cdot$}MPa--1, which was several orders of magnitudes higher than GO-based membranes for similar applications reported in the literature. The GO nanosheets were completely immobilized in the sponge by cross-linking with PVA, and thus, there was no GO nanoparticle leaching or flushing out into the treated permeate water, which was another advantage over direct use of GO powders in water treatment. Because of the high water permeability and CFAC, the cross-linked GO/PVA sponges have a great potential for wastewater treatment.},

The gibbsite precipitation experiments were conducted batchwise in a temperature range from 55 C to 90 C, but all with the same initial liquor composition and seed type. At low supersaturation it was found that gibbsite crystal growth could be described satisfactorily by a screw dislocation growth mechanism over the complete temperature range, irrespective of the flow regime. At higher supersaturation and lower temperatures, i.e. 55 C and 60 C, it is proposed that two-dimensional polynuclear growth is the dominant growth mechanism in turbulent flows. Any differences observed in the measured growth rate estimates from the laminar and turbulent systems were explained by error analysis.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) has attracted increasing attention for seawater and brackish water desalination, wastewater treatment, and concentration of juices and pharmaceutical solutions due to its feasibility of using low-grade energy and achieving high solute rejection. However, the successful implementation of MD technology is still impeded by membrane wetting resulted from membrane scaling by inorganic crystals and membrane fouling by organic matters in the feed solutions, especially when dealing with challenging wastewaters. Herein, this study describes a novel strategy to develop a robust and superhydrophobic membrane via electrospinning followed by electrospray to enhance membrane anti-wetting properties caused by scaling and fouling. The robust superhydrophobic membrane PDMS-3 comprised a superhydrophobic surface layer fabricated by electrospraying a PVDF/PDMS/silica fume blended solution and an electrospun nanofibrous PVDF support. The newly developed membrane PDMS-3 not only exhibited an outstanding superhydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 170{$^0$} {\textpm} 1{$^0$}, but also showed a unique anti-abrasive feature, which still possessed a slippery superhydrophobic property after 40 abrasion cycles. Moreover, the DCMD tests revealed that this rigid superhydrophobic surface rendered PDMS-3 with the best anti-scaling and anti-fouling properties compared to the nanofibrous and commercial PVDF membranes. It could achieve a superior MD flux of 28~kg~m-2 h-1and a stable salt rejection above 99.99\% during a continuous 160-h DCMD operation when the feed and permeation solutions were 3.5~wt\% NaCl solution at 333K and distillate water at 293~K, respectively. These results underline the importance of anti-abrasive superhydrophobic membrane development to deal with wastewaters containing diverse inorganic and organic matters via MD.},

Herein, we describe a microsphere structured composite membrane (\#PCNT-0.5) with simultaneous superior light-to-heat conversion and superhydrophobic properties, produced by electrospraying a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) hybrid solution on an electrospun PVDF nanofibrous substrate (\#PVDF). The carbon-based material and a micro-rough structure endowed the membrane with high light absorptivity, heat recovery and vapor production. Meanwhile, it showed excellent wetting resistance with contact angles beyond 150{\textopenbullet} and 120{\textopenbullet} for deionized (DI) water and 40\% v/v ethanol aqueous solutions. The robustness of the surface multifunctional coating of \#PCNT-0.5 was confirmed by chemical erosions and physical treatments. The localized heating alleviated the temperature polarization, increased the permeation flux of the \#PCNT-0.5 by {\textasciitilde}15\% and reduced its specific thermal energy consumption. In addition, the modified \#PCNT-0.5 exhibited better anti-scaling properties compared to \#PVDF. The illumination slowed down the flux decline of \#PCNT-0.5 and inhibited salt crystallization. The excellent anti-scaling properties of the illuminated \#PCNT-0.5 are attributed to the inhibited bulk and heterogeneous crystallization, permission of slippage and accelerated dissolution-diffusion. This study demonstrates that PMD is a feasible and promising method for hypersaline wastewater desalination.},

  abstract = {The main challenges for membranes used in membrane distillation (MD) are well-designed porous structure and hydrophobic surface property. Hydrophobic nanofiber membranes possess high hydrophobicity, high surface porosity and adjustable pore sizes and membrane thickness, which make them an attractive candidate as MD membrane. The current study aims to fabricate and optimize polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber membranes for MD application. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), capillary flow porometer, geniometer, a homemade setup for liquid entry pressure (LEP) measurement and direct contact MD (DCMD) setup were used to characterize the resultant nanofiber PVDF membranes. Polymer dope compositions, spinning parameters such as sprayer moving speed and chamber moisture were optimized to examine their effects on pore size distribution of the membranes. Inorganic additives were also added into the dope to improve the electro-spinability of diluted polymer dopes in order to further decrease membrane pore size. Meanwhile, a heat-press post-treatment was considered as a necessary step to improve fresh nanofiber membrane integrity, enhance water permeation flux and help prevent membrane pores from wetting in DCMD operation. The experiment confirmed that all the electrospun membranes exhibit a rough surface with high hydrophobicity ( 4 1351 water contact angle). The post-treated PVDF nanofiber membranes were able to present a steady water permeation flux of about 21 kg m{\`A}2 h{\`A}1 throughout the entire testing period of 15 h, using a 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution as the feed under the feed and permeate inlet temperatures of 323 K and 293 K, respectively. This result was better than these of commercial PVDF membranes and the nanofiber PVDF-clay membrane reported in literature, suggesting the competency of PVDF nanofiber membranes for DCMD applications.},

  abstract = {Scale deposits in water systems often result in ample technical and economic problems. Conventional chemical treatments for scale control are expensive and may cause health concerns and ecological implications. Non-chemical water treatment technologies such as electromagnetic field (EMF) are attractive options so the use of scale inhibitors, anti-scalants, or other chemical involved processes can be avoided or minimized. Although there are demonstrated beneficial effects of EMF on scale control, the scientific basis for its purported effectiveness is not clear in the available literature, especially lack of quantitative assessment and systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of EMF technologies. This review aims to elucidate the factors pertaining to EMF water treatment and their anti-scaling effects. We have critically reviewed relevant literature on EMF scale control, in particular recent studies, in various water systems, including desalination membranes, heat exchangers (e.g., cooling towers), water pipes, and bulk solutions. We systematically studied the impacts of operational conditions on EMF efficacy, and quantitatively evaluated the EMF improvement on scaling control. The scaling prevention mechanisms, conventional and cutting-edge characterization methods, and potential real-time monitoring techniques are summarized and discussed. The economic benefits of EMF treatment in terms of chemicals, operation and maintenance costs are highlighted. This review provides guidelines for future EMF system design and points out the research needed to further enhance EMF treatment performance.},

MWT efficiency was evaluated by amounts of scale precipitated in boilers and pipes during three-weeks run of two parallel experimental lines---one with and another without magnetic treatment. All scales were identified by X-ray diffractometer to be aragonite, but in the case of magnetic treatment, scales occurred in much smaller amounts: the scale on heating copper-pipe spiral was 2.5-times thinner due to MWT and in zinc-coated steel pipe occurred as very thin powder-like coating, while in the line without the treatment abundant hard lining was formed. The scales' morphology was observed by scanning electron microscope: the husks from both lines consisted of parallel distributed needles, but these crystals were about four times thinner in the case of MWT. The present work demonstrates that hard scale deposits can form even under conditions where aragonite precipitates predominantly, and that MWT can also affect the crystallization of this polymorph in a manner conducive to scaling control.},

Hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes adhered firmly by the hybrid coatings, are endowed with superhydrophilicity/underwater superoleophobicity, excellent antifouling performance, ultrahigh water flux (6343.2 L m-2 h-1 bar-1), highly efficient oil-in-water emulsion separating capability (filtrate flux = 544.26 L m-2 h-1 bar-1) and gravity-driven separation capability.

This study made the first attempt to analyze the interplay between the growing crystals and the porous structures in the framework of Stoney's equation. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was exploited to measure the membrane shift, whereby the scaling-induced deformation was correlated with the variation in stress created in the crystal-containing layer. Along with the stress analysis, the OCT-based characterization was combined with conventional approaches to ascertain the dependence of the scaling-induced wetting on the rate of concentrating the crystallizing species when arriving at a high degree of supersaturation in the feed. This study would refine the physical picture for better understanding crystal-membrane interactions that result in not only the wetting phenomenon but also the irreversible damage of membrane structures, thereby lending itself to the development of strategies for MD-based applications with improved efficiency.},

The scaling behaviors of MD concentration were compared between pulse and steady flow conditions using supersaturated gypsum or silica solutions. The pulse flow creates a state of regular vibration of the membrane, which disrupts the aggregation and deposition of particles on the surface and reducing temperature and concentration polarization. Comparing to steady flow, the pulse flow resulted in lower scaling propensity and a slightly higher initial flux of the PVDF membrane for both scaling types. The exploration of flow dynamics has provided a strategy for mitigating mineral scaling in membrane distillation, indicating that operation process optimization can contribute significantly to a robust and durable MD process.},

However, membrane scaling is still a critical issue for common hydrophobic MD membranes. Herein, we report a multi-layered surface modification strategy on the commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane via plasma treatment and surface fluorination cycles. The repeated plasma treatment process generates more reaction sites for the fluorination reaction, leading to higher fluorination density and more branched structures. MD tests with CaSO4 as the scaling agent show that the modification strategy mentioned above improves the membrane scaling resistance. Notably, the PVDF membrane treated with three cycles of plasma and fluorination treatments exhibits the best anti-scaling performance while maintaining almost the same membrane flux as the unmodified PVDF membrane. This study suggests that a highly branched surface molecular structure with low surface energy benefits the MD process in both membrane flux and scaling resistance. Besides, our research demonstrates a universal and facile approach for membrane treatment to improve membrane scaling resistance.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) has potential to become a competitive technology for managing hypersaline brine but not until the critical challenge of mineral scaling is addressed. The state-of-the-art approach for mitigating mineral scaling in MD involves the use of superhydrophobic membranes that are difficult to fabricate and are commercially unavailable. This study explores a novel operational strategy, namely, negative pressure direct contact membrane distillation (NP-DCMD) that can minimize mineral scaling with commercially available hydrophobic membranes and at the same time enhance the water vapor flux substantially. By applying a negative gauge pressure on the feed stream, NP-DCMD achieved prolonged resistance to CaSO4 scaling and a dramatic vapor flux enhancement up to 62\%. The exceptional scaling resistance is attributable to the formation of a concave liquid-gas under a negative pressure that changes the position of the water-air interface to hinder interfacial nucleation and crystal growth. The substantial flux enhancement is caused by the reduced molecular diffusion resistance within the pores and the enhanced heat transfer kinetics across the boundary layer in NP-DCMD.

  abstract = {Despite the relevance to most aspects of crystallization, a comprehensive understanding of the kinetics of heterogeneous nucleation has not been well established yet. In this paper, a new kinetic model based on the "steady-state" approach will be put forward to describe both heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation. As a key point in this model, the effect of foreign particles on both the nucleation barrier, the "chain reaction" process and the transport of structural units is taken into account. Ranging from low to high supersaturations, heterogeneous nucleation plays a more comprehensive role in nucleation than we expected, depending on the size of foreign particles and the interaction and structural matching between foreign particles and the nucleating phase. It follows that genuine homogeneous nucleation may only be possible at very high supersaturations, and can become easier when convection is eliminated. The results have been verified by the CaCO3 nucleation experiments. This general model allows us to describe many unexpected nucleation phenomena for the first time, and will have significant impact on the control of nucleation, understanding of crystallization in microgravity, the measurement of the crystal-fluid interfacial tension, and crystallization in general.

The agglomeration kernel model was derived using chemical reaction engineering principles and data from an extensive experimental program covering a wide range of temperatures, supersaturations, seed sizes, shear rates and mixing regimes. The experimental precipitation data in the laminar flow regime were generated using a novel Taylor--Couette precipitator. Data in the turbulent regime were generated in a stirred reactor. The developed agglomeration kernel model incorporates terms for the collision, capture, rupture and cementation rates affecting the formation of agglomerates. The model is shown to be able to predict the data from independent experiments. The proposed model also captures the complex non-linear shear rate and size-dependency observed experimentally, e.g. (1) for small particles the agglomeration kernel exhibits a maximum with respect to the shear rate, increasing at low shear rates in the laminar flow, but decreasing in the unstable Taylor--Couette flows and turbulent regimes; (2) for large particles the agglomeration kernel decreases monotonically with increasing shear.},

However, real MD applications still lag behind with only a few pilot-plant tests worldwide. The lack of technology transfer from academia to industry is caused by important gaps between its fundamental basis and the process design. Herein, we explore critical disconnections by conducting coupled mass and heat transfer modeling and MD simulations; we use well-known MD mass and heat transfer equations to model and simulate flux over a typical MD membrane for different geometries, areas, and operational conditions in direct contact configuration. From the analysis of the results, we propose research guidelines and process development strategies, and construct an               MD module performance curve               . From this graph, permeate flow rate, thermal energy consumption and outlet temperatures can be determined for given feed inlet conditions (temperature and concentration).

To date, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies of DCMD focus primarily on temperature polarization. However, when treating hypersaline brines, concentration polarization is an additional challenge that reduces system efficiency and leads to mineral scaling. To study coupled temperature and concentration polarization in the DCMD treatment of hypersaline brines, we develop an experimentally validated two-dimensional CFD code that simulates heat and mass transport in plate-and-frame DCMD systems. We then perform a comprehensive parametric study of polarization phenomena for a wide range of feed and distillate operating conditions, system length, and co-current versus counter-current operation. We also investigate the system-level performance by measuring the average permeate flux, single-pass water recovery, maximum concentration polarization coefficient, and gained output ratio of DCMD systems with heat recovery. Though the transmembrane vapor flux is small, we observe dramatic increases in solute concentration at the membrane surface, exceeding 1.6 times the feed value. The temperatures, concentration, and vapor flux vary considerably in the downstream direction, and are poorly approximated by common Nusselt and Sherwood correlations.},

Herein, a comparative investigation was performed to reveal the mechanism of salt on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) induced membrane wetting via the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) process. The results showed that different cations exhibited contrasting influences on membrane wetting. Compared to Na+, Mg2+ and Al3+, Ca2+ and K+ triggered significant flux increase. However, Ca2+ alleviated membrane wetting once feed temperature decreased. Feed solution characteristics indicated that Ca2+ and K+ significantly enhanced the Krafft point and hydrophobicity of micelles. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed the microcosmic interaction of Ca2+ and SDS, and verified that Ca2+ compressed the headgroup volume of SDS. By combining the critical packing parameter (CPP) of surfactants, dehydration of cations and micelle filtration experiments, it was concluded that the cations with weak hydration function in compressing the hydration layer of headgroups and facilitating the formation of more compact micelles that carry more SDS monomers, thus creating the transient adsorption of SDS in membrane pores and rapid membrane wetting.

Therefore, the nanoscale heat transfer characteristics inside the aerogel materials and the existing mathematical models for calculating the thermal conductivity of various heat transfer modes at the nanoscale need to be summarized in detail. Moreover, in order to verify the accuracy of the thermal conductivity calculation model of aerogel nano-porous materials, correct experimental data are required to modify the model.

Herein, we investigate the performance of two neural operators, which have shown promising results so far, and we develop new practical extensions that will make them more accurate and robust and importantly more suitable for industrial-complexity applications. The first neural operator, DeepONet, was published in 2019 (Lu et al., 2019), and its original architecture was based on the universal approximation theorem of Chen \& Chen (1995). The second one, named Fourier Neural Operator or FNO, was published in 2020 (Li et al., 2020), and it is based on parameterizing the integral kernel in the Fourier space. DeepONet is represented by a summation of products of neural networks (NNs), corresponding to the branch NN for the input function and the trunk NN for the output function; both NNs are general architectures, e.g., the branch NN can be replaced with a CNN or a ResNet. According to Kovachki et al. (2021), FNO in its continuous form can be viewed conceptually as a DeepONet with a specific architecture of the branch NN and a trunk NN represented by a trigonometric basis. In order to compare FNO with DeepONet computationally for realistic setups, we develop several extensions of FNO that can deal with complex geometric domains as well as mappings where the input and output function spaces are of different dimensions. We also develop an extended DeepONet with special features that provide inductive bias and accelerate training, and we present a faster implementation of DeepONet with cost comparable to the computational cost of FNO, which is based on the Fast Fourier Transform. We consider 16 different benchmarks to demonstrate the relative performance of the two neural operators, including instability wave analysis in hypersonic boundary layers, prediction of the vorticity field of a flapping airfoil, porous media simulations in complex-geometry domains, etc. We follow the guiding principles of FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) for scientific data management and stewardship. The performance of DeepONet and FNO is comparable for relatively simple settings, but for complex geometries the performance of FNO deteriorates greatly. We also},

While these materials are usually produced as monoliths, this paper describes a new method for the production of organic aerogel microsphere powders. Supercritical drying provides highly porous aerogels which have an open-cell structure consisting of interconnected solid particles with typical diameters of 10 nm. The structure is controlled by the sol-gel polymerization conditions. This paper addresses the correlation between structure and thermal conductivity of these novel materials. Thermal conductivity measurements have been performed on both monoliths and powders using a hot-wire device. The measurements under variation of gas pressure as well as spectral infrared transmission measurements allow the determination of the solid, gaseous and radiative thermal conductivity as a function of density and catalyst concentration. The results show that the thermal conductivity components are clearly correlated with the aerogel structure: porosity and connectivity between the particles determine the solid conductivity, while the pore size influences the gaseous conductivity and radiative transport depends on the mass specific infrared absorption of the building units.},

  abstract = {Management of produced water from shale gas production is a global challenge. Vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) is considered a promising solution because of its various advantages. However, low-surface-tension species in produced water can easily deposit on the membrane surface and cause severe fouling or wetting problems. To solve the problems, an omniphobic polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) hollow-fiber membrane has been developed via silica nanoparticle deposition followed by a Teflon AF 2400 coating in this study. The resultant membrane shows good repellency toward various liquids with different surface tensions and chemistries, including water, ethylene glycol (EG), cooking oil, and ethanol. It also exhibits stable performance in 7 h VMD tests with a feed solution containing up to 0.6 mM of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In addition, the effects of surface energy and surface morphology as well as nanoparticle size on membrane omniphobicity have been systematically investigated. This work may provide valuable guidance to molecularly design omniphobic VMD membranes for produced water treatment.},

Aerogels have a very low solid thermal conductivity due to their extremely high porosity. Nanosize pores are responsible for partial suppression of gaseous conduction. A low radiative conductivity caused mainly by absorption is observed for organic aerogels. In the case of SiO2-aerogels, the radiative transport can be reduced by integrating an opacifier such as carbon black in the SiO2-skeleton.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation has attracted great attention in the development of sustainable desalination and zero-discharge processes because of its possibility of recovering 100\% water and the potential for integration with low-grade heat, such as solar energy. However, the conventional membrane structures and materials afford limited flux thus obstructing its practical application. Here, ultrathin nanoporous graphene membranes are reported by selectively forming thin graphene layers on the top edges of a highly porous anodic alumina oxide support, which creates short and fast transport pathways for water vapor but not liquid. The process avoids the challenging pore-generation and substrate-transfer processes required to prepare regular graphene membranes. In the direct-contact membrane distillation mode under a mild temperature pair of 65/25 {$^\circ$}C, the nanoporous graphene membranes show an average water flux of 421.7 L m-2 h-1 with over 99.8\% salt rejection, which is an order of magnitude higher than any reported polymeric membranes. The mechanism for high water flux is revealed by detailed characterizations and theoretical modeling. Outdoor field tests using water from the Red Sea heated under direct sunlight radiation show that the membranes have an average water flux of 86.3 L m-2 h-1 from 8 am to 8 pm, showing a great potential for real applications in seawater desalination.},

The effects of different SiO2 contents on various physical properties of membranes such as the porosity, electrolyte absorption rate, electrochemical stability, and especially thermal stability of the SiO2/ PVDF composite membranes were systematically studied. Compared with a commercial polypropylene separator, the SiO2/PVDF membrane has a higher porosity (66.0\%), electrolyte absorption (239\%), and ion conductivity (1.0 mS{$\cdot$}cm-1) and superior thermal stability (only 2.1\% shrinkage at 200 {$^\circ$}C for 2 h) and flame retardancy. When the content of SiO2 in the membrane reached 60\% (i.e., PS6), LiFePO4/PS6/Li half-cells exhibited excellent cycle stability (138.2 mA h{$\cdot$}g-1 discharging capacity after 100 cycles at 1C) and Coulombic efficiency (99.1\%). The above advantages coupled with the potential for rapid and large-scale production reveal that the ``polymer-in-ceramic'' SiO2/PVDF membrane has prospective separator applications in secondary lithium-ion batteries.},

Herein, 3D porous graphene hydrogel (GH) is developed as a super-adsorbent to remove different pollutants (antibiotics, dyes, and heavy ions) for water purification. Due to its highly porous structure and high content of water, GH also demonstrated its super adsorption capacity for adsorbing and removing different pollutants (antibiotics, dyes, and heavy ions) as compared to conventional graphene aerogel (GA). More fundamentally, the buried-water enhanced adsorption mechanism was proposed and demonstrated, such that buried water in GH plays the combinatorial roles as (1) supporting media, (2) transport nanochannels, and (3) hydrogen bondings in promoting pollutant adsorption. In parallel, molecular dynamics simulations further confirm that buried water in GH has the stronger interaction with pollutants via hydrogen bonds than other buried alcohols. GH integrates the merit of both graphene (e.g., fine chemical resistance and excellent mechanical property) and hydrogel (e.g., high water content, porous structure, and simple solution-based processability and scalability), giving it promising potential for environmental applications.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) has been proven promising in solar-driven desalination. Moreover, its unique characteristics such as simple process, module compactness, high salt rejection rate, etc. allow for a small-scale device in a distributed system. Both theoretical and experimental researches on the cou-pling between solar collectors and MD aiming at compact and autonomous desalination system have been devoted to enhance freshwater productivity and energy efficiency. In this paper, certain critical gaps are summarized upon a panoramic review of the current status, including limited production and energy performance compared with commercial-scale desalination, unclear relation between solar collecting area and membrane area, and few discussions on efficient condensation, etc. To tackle these challenges, per-spectives on the essential future research directions are proposed. Solar direct heating and solar concen-tration constitute the possible resolution to enhance solar energy utilization for higher water production, which also raise the question of optimizing solar/MD areas. Meanwhile, module stacking, module internal heat recovery and external evaporation heat recovery are deemed prospective in further reducing MD en-ergy consumption. Subsequently, an enhanced vapor condensation needs more exploration. Those aspects and a potential combination among them are the main tasks in the near future, together with more field tests on small distributed solar-driven MD systems. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The EPSCD system integrates thermoelectric devices and effectively com\- bines multistage membrane distillation and heat recovery in a single, compact unit to efficiently manage the energy requirement for the desalination process. Inside the EPSCD system, thermo\- electric coolers, arranged in parallel electrically, provide the driving force for the process by pumping the heats of condensation (associated with vapor transport) and conduction (through the membrane) from the cold side back to the hot side for vaporization. The proposed system is simple in design and can achieve instant water desalination with excellent salt rejection and relatively low power consumption. Preliminary results indicate that an energy efficiency up to 86\% and a corresponding specific energy consumption of 780 kWh/m3 can be achieved with this system.},

Here we show that in ocellated lizards a quasi-hexagonal lattice of skin scales, rather than individual chromatophore cells, establishes a green and black labyrinthine pattern of skin colour. We analysed time series of lizard scale colour dynamics over four years of their development and demonstrate that this pattern is produced by a cellular automaton (a grid of elements whose states are iterated according to a set of rules based on the states of neighbouring elements) that dynamically computes the colour states of individual mesoscopic skin scales to produce the corresponding macroscopic colour pattern. Using numerical simulations and mathematical derivation, we identify how a discrete von Neumann cellular automaton emerges from a continuous Turing reaction--diffusion system. Skin thickness variation generated by three-dimensional morphogenesis of skin scales causes the underlying reaction--diffusion dynamics to separate into microscopic and mesoscopic spatial scales, the latter generating a cellular automaton. Our study indicates that cellular automata are not merely abstract computational systems, but can directly correspond to processes generated by biological evolution.},

  abstract = {AgI is one of the best-investigated ice-nucleating substances. It has relevance for the atmosphere since it is used for glaciogenic cloud seeding. Theoretical and experimental studies over the last 60 years provide a complex picture of silver iodide as an ice-nucleating agent with conflicting and inconsistent results. This review compares experimental ice nucleation studies in order to analyze the factors that influence the ice nucleation ability of AgI. The following picture emerges from this analysis: the ice nucleation ability of AgI seems to be enhanced when the AgI particle is on the surface of a droplet, which is indeed the position that a particle takes when it can freely move in a droplet. The ice nucleation by particles with surfaces exposed to air depends on water adsorption. AgI surfaces seem to be most efficient at nucleating ice when they are exposed to relative humidity at or even above water saturation. For AgI particles that are completely immersed in water, the freezing temperature increases with increasing AgI surface area. Higher threshold freezing temperatures seem to correlate with improved lattice matches as can be seen for AgI--AgCl solid solutions and 3AgI qNH4I q6H2O, which have slightly better lattice matches with ice than AgI and also higher threshold freezing temperatures. However, the effect of a good lattice match is annihilated when the surfaces have charges. Also, the ice nucleation ability seems to decrease during dissolution of AgI particles. This introduces an additional history and time dependence for ice nucleation in cloud chambers with short residence times.},

Past studies have demonstrated that both VEDCMD and FO can be effectively utilized in the treatment of a wide range of highly concentrated feed solutions. In the current study, two reverse osmosis (RO) brine streams with total dissolved solids concentrations averaging 7500 and 17,500 mg/L were further desalinated by VEDCMD and by FO. In both processes, high water recoveries were achieved; however, recoveries were limited by precipitation of inorganic salts on the membrane surface. Various cleaning techniques were able to remove the scale layer from the membrane and restore water flux to almost initial levels. FO achieved water recoveries up to 90\% from the brines and VEDCMD achieved water recoveries up to 81\% from the brines. Addition of a scale inhibitor during both processes was effective at maintaining high water flux for extended time. When considering the total water recovery (the recovery from the RO processes combined with the batch recovery from the VEDCMD or FO process), greater than 96 and 98\% total recoveries were achieved for the two different brine streams.},

A coefficient which measures this reduction has been introduced.

  abstract = {Scale formation is a common problem in a wide range of industries such as oil and gas, water desalination, and food processing. Conventional solutions for this problem including mechanical removal and chemical dissolution are inefficient, costly, and sometimes environmentally hazardous. Surface modification approaches have shown promises to address this challenge. However, these approaches suffer from intrinsic existence of solid liquid interfaces leading to high rate of scale nucleation and high adhesion strength of the formed scale. Here, we report a new surface called magnetic slippery surface in two forms of Newtonian fluid (MAGSS) and gel structure (GelMAGSS). These surfaces provide a liquid liquid interface to elevate the energy barrier for scale nucleation and minimize the adhesion strength of the formed scale on the surface. Performance of these new surfaces in both static and dynamic (under fluid flow) configurations is examined. These surfaces show superior antiscaling properties with an order of magnitude lower scale accretion compared to the solid surfaces and offer longevity and stability under high shear flow conditions. We envision that these surfaces open a new path to address the scale problem in the relevant technologies.},

  abstract = {Reverse osmosis is becoming popular for the purification of water resources e.g. sea and brackish water. However, one of the major limitations in efficient operation are the fouling of membranes and relevant technique used to inhibit scaling due to the presence of sparingly soluble salts. The occurrence of this type of fouling results in a significant increase in both operation and maintenance. This review begins by providing a general overview of membrane fouling by minerals usually found in sea and inland water resources. The paper then discusses some important aspects of the phenomena itself: different mechanisms; concentration polarization; the major types of mineral scales including their prevalence and characteristics; and consequences of fouling on membrane performance. This is followed by a discussion of the major strategies currently considered for the control and prevention of scale formation. The penultimate section discusses the drawbacks and deficiencies of current systems in operation and highlights potential future directions that need to be pursued in order to achieve overall process improvements in terms of sustainability. In particular, the need for evaluation under more realistic conditions, studying the interactions between membrane and spacer surface and foulants, and the development of environmentally benign antiscalants are stressed.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of crystal growth of gypsum is determined by measuring the 3D time-evolution of isolated microcrystals (similar to 10 mu m characteristic dimension) by in situ AFM. By coupling such measurements to a well-posed diffusion model, the importance of mass transport to the overall rate can be elucidated readily. Indeed, because microscale interfaces that act as source or sink sites are characterized by intrinsically high diffusion rates, it is possible to study crystal growth free from mass transport effects in many instances. In the present study, a particular focus is to elucidate how the ratio of Ca2+ to SO42- ions at constant supersaturation influences the rate of growth at the major crystal faces of gypsum. It is found that growth at the \{100\} and \{001\} faces, in particular, is highly sensitive to solution stoichiometry, resulting in needle-like crystals forming in Ca2+ -rich solutions and plate-like crystals forming in SO42- (-)rich solutions. The maximum growth rate occurs with a stoichiometric solution of Ca2+:SO42- The much slower growing basal \{010\} face also shows a stoichiometry dependence and growth is found to occur at step sites in growth hillocks. Importantly, overall growth rates derived by measuring the volumetric expansion of microcrystals by 3D in situ AFM are in reasonable agreement with previous bulk studies on suspensions. This study is a further illustration that the study of individual microcrystals is a powerful approach for resolving face-specific kinetics and in providing a link between microscopic observations and macroscopic rates in bulk systems. In this study it has further been possible to link face-specific kinetics to the resulting crystal morphology.},

Contact angles decreased by 56\% and 26\% on the feed and distillate sides, respectively. Surface roughness also decreased by 92\% and 57\% on the feed and distillate sides, respectively. Moderate morphological changes were also observed after 20 days of operation. While decreased hydrophobicity and surface roughness on the feed side were associated with fouling/scaling deposits and not changes to the actual membrane surface, decreased hydrophobicity and surface roughness on the distillate side indicated changes to the actual membrane surface. Often, membrane hydrophobicity is assumed to be recoverable if foulants can be removed; however, if membrane hydrophobicity decreases due to physical changes in the membrane surface, hydrophobicity may not be fully recoverable and membrane lifetime may be reduced. Despite significant reductions in feed-side hydrophobicity, distillate conductivity remained low, indicating that other membrane characteristics, such as distillate-side and internal or pore wall hydrophobicity, may play an important role in maintaining rejection during long-term operation.},

Temperature data and solidification parameters under different process parameters are obtained by finite element method, which establish connections between macroscopic temperature field and microstructure simulation. In addition, the effects of different process parameters on dendrite morphology, element segregation and grain structure are investigated. The primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS), Nb element precipitation and grain size all increase with the increase of laser power, which are caused by the decrease of cooling rate.

  abstract = {Hierarchically designed structures with architectural features that span across multiple length scales are found in numerous hard biomaterials, like bone, wood, and glass sponge skeletons, as well as manmade structures, like the Eiffel Tower. It has been hypothesized that their mechanical robustness and damage tolerance stem from sophisticated ordering within the constituents, but the specific role of hierarchy remains to be fully described and understood. We apply the principles of hierarchical design to create structural metamaterials from three material systems: (i) polymer, (ii) hollow ceramic, and (iii) ceramic--polymer composites that are patterned into self-similar unit cells in a fractal-like geometry. In situ nanomechanical experiments revealed (i) a nearly theoretical scaling of structural strength and stiffness with relative density, which outperforms existing nonhierarchical nanolattices; (ii) recoverability, with hollow alumina samples recovering up to 98\% of their original height after compression to {$\geq$}50\% strain; (iii) suppression of brittle failure and structural instabilities in hollow ceramic hierarchical nanolattices; and (iv) a range of deformation mechanisms that can be tuned by changing the slenderness ratios of the beams. Additional levels of hierarchy beyond a second order did not increase the strength or stiffness, which suggests the existence of an optimal degree of hierarchy to amplify resilience. We developed a computational model that captures local stress distributions within the nanolattices under compression and explains some of the underlying deformation mechanisms as well as validates the measured effective stiffness to be interpreted as a metamaterial property.},

We demonstrate the creation of structural metamaterials composed of nanoscale ceramics that are simultaneously ultralight, strong, and energy-absorbing and can recover their original shape after compressions in excess of 50\% strain. Hollow-tube alumina nanolattices were fabricated using two-photon lithography, atomic layer deposition, and oxygen plasma etching. Structures were made with wall thicknesses of 5 to 60 nanometers and densities of 6.3 to 258 kilograms per cubic meter. Compression experiments revealed that optimizing the wall thickness-to-radius ratio of the tubes can suppress brittle fracture in the constituent solid in favor of elastic shell buckling, resulting in ductile-like deformation and recoverability.},

  abstract = {This study investigates gypsum scaling and cleaning behavior in forward osmosis (FO). The results show that gypsum scaling in FO is almost fully reversible, with more than 96\% recovery of permeate water flux following a water rinse without addition of chemical cleaning reagents. Parallel comparisons of fouling and cleaning were made between FO (without hydraulic pressure) and RO (under high hydraulic pressure) modes. The shape of the water flux decline curves during gypsum scaling is similar in the two modes, but the flux recovery in FO mode is higher than that in RO mode by about 10\%. This behavior suggests that operating in FO mode may reduce the need for chemical cleaning. The role of membrane materials in controlling gypsum scaling and cleaning was investigated using cellulose acetate (CA) and polyamide (PA) membranes. Gypsum scaling of PA membranes causes more severe flux decline and is harder to clean than that of CA membranes. AFM force measurements were performed between a gypsum particle probe and the membrane surfaces to elucidate gypsum scaling mechanisms. Analysis of adhesion force data indicates that gypsum scaling of the PA membrane is dominated by heterogeneous/surface crystallization, while gypsum scaling of the CA membrane is dominated by bulk crystallization and subsequent particle deposition. This finding implies that membrane surface modification and new material development can be an effective strategy to mitigate membrane scaling.},

  abstract = {Vacuum membrane distillation is a novel separation process that requires less energy and provides high selec\- tivity. However, membrane fouling is a severe issue in the commercialization of this process. One of the methods to minimize membrane fouling is the use of appropriate operating conditions. In this study, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based approach is used to model the vacuum membrane distillation process and analyze the effects of operating parameters on membrane fouling. An ANN was developed through MATLAB's Deep Learning Toolbox. First, the number of nodes in the hidden layer was optimized. The minimum value of mean square error (0.58) was achieved with ten nodes. The model predictions were successfully validated with a correlation co\- efficient of more than 0.98. The trained ANN was then used to analyze the effects of operating conditions on flux and membrane fouling. High membrane fouling was observed at high feed temperature and vacuum tightness. Higher feed solute concentrations were also responsible for high membrane fouling. In the optimization study, high feed temperature and moderate to high vacuum tightness for lower solute concentration; and high feed temperature and low to moderate vacuum tightness for higher solute concentration were found optimum operating conditions to achieve maximum fluxes.},

  abstract = {The aim of this work is to develop enabling tools that can assess the potential of zeolite membranes for industrial applications. The specific objectives are: (1) Develop a detailed mathematical model of a zeolite membrane separation process for accurate performance prediction under industrial conditions, and (2) Perform conceptual process design and techno-economic evaluation of the overall process for an application specific flowsheet. To this end, a detailed mathematical model, based on the real adsorption solution (RAS) theory and the Maxwell-Stefan formulation for transport was developed to describe permeation through a zeolite membrane. Effects like support resistances to transport, use of sweep gas and concentration polarization were included. The model is further applied to study butane isomer separation using a MFI-type zeolite membrane. A comparison of steady state flux and separation factor predicted by the model with the experimentally determined values suggests that the permeation in the real membranes is lower than that for the zeolite crystals. This lower permeance is attributed to the microstructural defects and suggests that there is a considerable scope of improvement in the performance of current state-of-the-art real MFI membranes. It is shown that up to a 10-fold increase in permeance through the membrane is practical, beyond which the external resistance starts to dominate. Furthermore, the detailed zeolite membrane model is integrated into a process level simulation, to evaluate the membrane performance in industrial settings, and a techno-economic analysis is also performed to this end. While single stage membrane process does not achieve the target purity and multi-stage membrane process requires prohibitively large area, a hybrid membrane/distillation process is found to be energy efficient and economically attractive.},

  abstract = {Water and silicon are chemically dissimilar substances with common physical properties. Their liquids display a temperature of maximum density, increased diffusivity on compression, and they form tetrahedral crystals and tetrahedral amorphous phases. The common feature to water, silicon, and carbon is the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated units. We exploit these similarities to develop a coarse-grained model of water (mW) that is essentially an atom with tetrahedrality intermediate between carbon and silicon. mW mimics the hydrogen-bonded structure of water through the introduction of a nonbond angular dependent term that encourages tetrahedral configurations. The model departs from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged forces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW has only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and structure of liquid water, and its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable or better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less than 1\% of the computational cost. We conclude that it is not the nature of the interactions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the structural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time provided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in deeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying transitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of biomolecules and complex materials.},

The melting temperature of water in the pore was Tporem = 223 K, 51 K lower than the melting point of bulk water in the model and in excellent agreement with experimental determinations for 3 nm silica pores. Liquid and ice coexist in equilibrium at the melting point and down to temperatures as low as 180 K. Liquid water is located at the interface of the pore wall, increasing from one monolayer at the freezing temperature, Tporef = 195 K, to two monolayers a few degrees below Tporem. Crystallization of ice in the pore occurs through homogeneous nucleation. At the freezing temperature, the critical nucleus contains {$\sim$}75 to 100 molecules, with a radius of gyration similar to the radius of the pore. The critical nuclei contain features of both cubic and hexagonal ice, although stacking of hexagonal and cubic layers is not defined until the nuclei reach {$\sim$}150 molecules. The structure of the confined ice is rich in stacking faults, in agreement with the interpretation of X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. Though the presence of cubic layers is twice as prevalent as hexagonal ones, the crystals should not be considered defective Ic as sequences with more than three adjacent cubic (or hexagonal) layers are extremely rare in the confined ice.},

One mystery is the question of what determines the lowest temperature to which water can be cooled before it freezes to ice. Rapid crystallization at low temperatures hampers experimental studies, and simulations are usually prohibitively costly in terms of computer time. Using a simple water model that allows demanding calculations, Emily Moore and Valeria Molinero now show that a sharp increase in the fraction of four-coordinated molecules in supercooled liquid water controls the rate and mechanism of ice formation. The structural change also results in a peak in the rate of crystallization at 225 K; below this temperature, ice nuclei form faster than liquid water can equilibrate. This finding explains the observed thermodynamic anomalies, and why homogeneous ice nucleation rates depend on the thermodynamics of water.},

It was observed that only 0.25\% concentration of defects in graphene lead to significant reduction of graphene thermal conductivity by around 50\%. By applying uniaxial tensile loading, we studied the deformation process of graphene. We found that elastic modulus, tensile strength and strain at failure of graphene decrease by increase of defects concentrations. Obtained results suggest that thermal conduction in graphene is much more vulnerable to defects in comparison with mechanical properties.

Based solely on the underlying physical equations and initial and boundary conditions, these new approaches allow to approximate, for example, the complex flow of blood in the case of fluid dynamics. Physics-informed neural networks offer certain advantages compared to conventional computational fluid dynamics methods as they avoid the need for discretized meshes and allow to readily solve inverse problems and integrate additional data into the algorithms. Today, the majority of published reports on learning-based flow modeling relies on fully-connected neural networks. However, many different network architectures are introduced into deep learning each year, each with specific benefits for certain applications. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive comparison of various state-of-the-art networks and evaluate their performance in terms of computational cost and accuracy relative to numerical references. We found that while fully-connected networks offer an attractive balance between training time and accuracy, more elaborate architectures (e.g., Deep Galerkin Method) generated superior results. Moreover, we observed high accuracy in simple cylindrical geometries, but slightly poorer estimates in complex aneurysms. This paper provides quantitative guidance for practitioners interested in complex flow modeling using physics-based deep learning.},

The results show that in random-distributed pore media, there is a percolation threshold ep, and this percolation threshold decreases with increasing coordination number of the pore network. The relationship between the effective diffusivity and porosity is strongly nonlinear when the porosity, e, is less than a certain value eL; for e {$>$} eL, the relationship becomes quasi-linear. This dividing point eL decreases with increasing coordination number. The larger the coordination number of the pore network, the higher the effective gas diffusivity.

The analysis of the saturation island density as a function of substrate temperature and deposition rate reveals that the smallest stable island abruptly changes from a dimer to a tetramer. From the Arrhenius plot, the migration barrier E(m)=(0.35+/-0.02) eV, as well as the dimer bond energy E(b)=(0.46+/-0.19) eV, has been deduced. For low ratios between the migration constant D and flux R (D/R{$<$}10(4)), nucleation and island growth take place not only during, but also after deposition. In this postnucleation regime, the final island density and island size distribution are no more determined by the competition between flux and monomer migration, but solely by the monomer concentration present immediately after deposition. Therefore, the island density becomes independent of substrate temperature and Aux, and the scaled island size distribution closely resembles that of statistic growth (adatom smallest stable island). The experimental results are compared with simulations using rate equations.},

  abstract = {We review non-equilibrium methods for calculating transport coefficients with emphasis on the reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) method. It has fundamental and technical advantages over previous equilibrium and non-equilibrium techniques. For example, it applies the perturbation in a microcanonical way (no thermostat needed) and its raw data are well defined and robust gradients, rather than, fluxes which are often difficult to define and to calculate with sufficient accuracy. The method has so far been applied to the calculation of viscosities, thermal conductivities and Soret coefficients. Finally, the status and future potential of the RNEMD method are discussed.},

The ``effect,'' the heat flux, is imposed on the system and the ``cause,'' the temperature gradient is obtained from the simulation. Besides being very simple to implement, the scheme offers several advantages such as compatibility with periodic boundary conditions, conservation of total energy and total linear momentum, and the sampling of a rapidly converging quantity (temperature gradient) rather than a slowly converging one (heat flux). The scheme is tested on the Lennard-Jones fluid.},

Herein, an interesting opportunity of enhancing membrane distillation performance by applying an external electromagnetic field to the feed stream is demonstrated. It has been proven that electromagnetic fields can affect water evaporation rate, which is primarily related to the effect of the electromagnetic field on the hydrogen bonds of water clusters. However, as of yet, the enhancement in MD performance through the assistance of electromagnetic fields has not been previously recognized. Herein, it is demonstrated that the permeate flux of membrane distillation can be increased by up to 10\% through exposing the saline feed water to an external electromagnetic field (EMF). It was found that the presence of divalent ions in the feed solution during the application of EMF resulted in a higher increase in permeate flux than when only NaCl was present. The electromagnetic treatment is non-destructive to current MD and thus can be easily adapted to large-scale water desalination processes.},

  abstract = {At present, around 25\% of water desalination processes are based on distillation. Similar to classical distillation, membrane distillation is a phased-change process in which a hydrophobic membrane separates two phases. Membrane distillation is considered an emerging player in the desalination, food processing and water treatment market. Due to its high salt rejection, less fouling propensity, operating at moderate temperature and pressure, membrane distillation is considered as a future sustainable desalination technology. The distillation process is quite well known in desalination. However, membrane distillation emerged a few decades ago, and a thorough understanding is needed to adapt this technique in the near future. This review chapter introduces the classical distillation and membrane distillation as an emerging technology in the desalination arena. Heat and mass transfer and thermodynamics in membrane distillation, characteristics of the performance metrics of membrane distillation are also described. Finally, the performance evaluation of MD is presented. The possibility of using low-grade heat in membrane distillation allows it to integrate directly to solar energy and industrial waste heat.},

  abstract = {The growth and phase transformation of calcium sulfate dihydrate and hemihydrate crystals were studied at temperatures from 70 to 130 deg. C. At 70 deg. C the second-order rate constant for dihydrate crystal growth did not change by more than 20 percent over a pH range of 3.2 to 9.2. It was also independent of ionic strength up to 2.0M. Growth in stable supersaturated calcium sulfate solution was completely inhibited by 7 x 10-7 M phytic acid for about 24 hours at 70 deg. C. The seeded crystallization of calcium sulfate hemihydrate at temperatures from 90 to 140 deg. C and The phase changes from a- to beta-hemihydrate were investigated by X-ray diffraction, specific surface area analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. Organic phosphonates were found to be effective inhibitors of crystal growth of all the phases at high temperatures.The phases that form during the crystallization of many sparingly soluble salts evidently are determined much more by kinetic factors than by thermodynamic considerations. Thus, in the case of calcium phosphate crystal growth, an amorphous precursor is formed rapidly at the beginning of the precursor is formed rapidly at the beginning of the reaction and undergoes slow transformation to the thermodynamically stable phase, hydroxyapatite. Significant changes with time are observed in such factors as chemical composition, crystallinity, and specific surface areas of the solid phases. The simple equilibrium studies do not reveal the factors that may be important in determining whether these phases will precipitate in the field. phases will precipitate in the field. The case of calcium sulfate, which is important in desalination, geochemistry, and petroleum engineering, is complicated further by the fact that it can crystalize from aqueous solutions in three forms- dehydrate (CaSO4 - 2H2O), hemihydrate (a-CaSO4 1/2 H2O or beta-CaSO4 - 1/2 H2O), and anhy-drite (CaSO4). These phases may be stable or unstable depending on temperature or ionic strength, and they have decreasing solubilities with increasing temperatures above about 40 deg. C. To understand the formation of these scale minerals, high-temperature laboratory methods must be used for the kinetic studies, allowing both solutions and solid phases to be sampled without spurious temperature effects. The kinetics of transformation of one hydrate to another is particularly important in determining the nature of the scale formed under field conditions as a function of both temperature and background electrolyte concentration.This investigation studied the formation and dissolution of calcium sulfate phases under some typical field conditions. Kinetic investigations were emphasized since these frequently can be used to predict the nature of the phases formed under specific conditions of concentration or temperature. Moreover, unlike the results of spontaneous precipitation experiments, such studies are highly reproducible. The effects of factors such as ionic strength, temperature, supersaturation, and effectiveness of scale inhibitors may be studied quantitatively. In addition, the influence of the nature of the seed crystal phase and morphology on the subsequent growth process can be investigated. The morphology of the crystals comprising scale deposits may be particularly important in determining whether they pack together as hard, destructive scale or remain as a sludge to be swept away by the liquid phase. Seeded-crystal growth processes are better models than are spontaneous processes are better models than are spontaneous precipitation studies for the scale formation reactions precipitation studies for the scale formation reactions in which the solid phase is formed heterogeneously either on a foreign substrate or on crystals of scale already present.The growth rate of calcium sulfate dihydrate seed crystals is independent of the fluid dynamics in the system, suggesting that the rate is not diffusion-controlled but depends on a surface reaction rate. This has particular significance for the formation of scale in the oil well because the scaling rate is expected to be independent of the dynamics of fluid flow at the metal surface.SPEJP. 133},

Conventional mineral scale inhibitors do not inhibit its formation. Chemical cleaning is difficult and not free from hazards. Research on silica scale formation and prevention is on-going and has led to various chemical approaches. This paper is focused on silica formation, deposition and its inhibition in desalination applications by following designed chemical approaches. More specifically, benchtop screening tests on various silica inhibition chemistries are reported, with emphasis on additives with dendrimeric or polymeric structure and backbone. The inhibition performance of Starburst(R) polyaminoamide (PAMAM) dendrimers of generations 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 are investigated in detail. Experimental results show that inhibition efficiency largely depends on structural features of PAMAM's such as generation number and nature of the end groups, as well as dosage levels. Poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) polymers of a variety of molecular weights are also investigated as potential SiO2 inhibitors. The general scope of silica formation and inhibition in waters relevant to desalination systems is also discussed.},

This is because nutrient material is carried to it on this side by bodily movement of solution, and also by diffusion, while on the lee side of the crystal the nutrient material is carried in large part only by diffusion. Thus, the direction of solution movement can often be determined by examination of the growth zones in minerals. This is usually done by sectioning the minerals. Lineages where present may also be used to determine the preferred growth direction. Crystal distortion may also be used. Overgrowths of crusts or scattered small crystals resting on an earlier crystal or other object also afford good evidence. Preferred corrosion or solution of a mineral or mineral aggregate is analogous. The vectorial properties of crystals interfere to some extent.These features have been studied on crystals formed in the laboratory and on many minerals and ores. The experimental work and several examples of ores and minerals are briefly described.},

  abstract = {Membrane scaling during the treatment of aqueous solutions containing sparingly soluble salts by direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) was investigated. The results reveal that membrane scaling caused by CaSO4 was more severe than that by CaCO3 or silicate. However, under the experimental condition used in this study and at feed and distillate temperature of 20{$^\circ$}C and 40{$^\circ$}C, respectively, CaSO4 scaling occurred only after a sufficiently long induction time of up to 25h (corresponding to a saturation index of up to 1.5). The induction period decreased and the size of the CaSO4 crystals increased as the feed temperature increased. SEM analysis reveals that prior to the onset of CaSO4 scaling, the membrane surface was relatively clean and was completely free of any large crystals. Subsequently, a simple operational regime involving regular membrane flushing to reset the induction period was developed and was proven to be effective in controlling CaSO4 scaling. At a low system recovery, the permeate flux was constant despite the fact that the feed solution was always at a super saturation condition. Results reported here also confirm the interplay between induction time and the saturation index.},

  abstract = {Clathrate hydrates and ice I are the most abundant crystals of water. The study of their nucleation, growth, and decomposition using molecular simulations requires an accurate and efficient algorithm that distinguishes water molecules that belong to each of these crystals and the liquid phase. Existing algorithms identify ice or clathrates, but not both. This poses a challenge for cases in which ice and hydrate coexist, such as in the synthesis of clathrates from ice and the formation of ice from clathrates during self-preservation of methane hydrates. Here we present an efficient algorithm for the identification of clathrate hydrates, hexagonal ice, cubic ice, and liquid water in molecular simulations. CHILL+ uses the number of staggered and eclipsed water--water bonds to identify water molecules in cubic ice, hexagonal ice, and clathrate hydrate. CHILL+ is an extension of CHILL (Moore et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2010, 12, 4124--4134), which identifies hexagonal and cubic ice but not clathrates. In addition to the identification of hydrates, CHILL+ significantly improves the detection of hexagonal ice up to its melting point.

To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that allows for the simultaneous identification of ice and clathrate hydrates, and it does so in a way that is competitive with respect to existing methods used to identify any of these crystals.},

  abstract = {Ultra-light porous networks based on nano-carbon materials (such as graphene or carbon nanotubes) have attracted increasing interest owing to their applications in wide fields from bioengineering to electrochemical devices. However, it is often difficult to translate the properties of nanomaterials to bulk three-dimensional networks with a control of their mechanical properties. In this work, we constructed elastomeric graphene porous networks with well-defined structures by freeze casting and thermal reduction and investigated systematically the effect of key microstructural features. The porous networks made of large reduced graphene oxide flakes ({$>$}20\,{$\mu$}m) are superelastic and exhibit high energy absorption, showing much enhanced mechanical properties than those with small flakes ({$<$}2\,{$\mu$}m). A better restoration of the graphitic nature also has a considerable effect. In comparison, microstructural differences, such as the foam architecture or the cell size have smaller or negligible effect on the mechanical response. The recoverability and energy adsorption depend on density with the latter exhibiting a minimum due to the interplay between wall fracture and friction during deformation. These findings suggest that an improvement in the mechanical properties of porous graphene networks significantly depend on the engineering of the graphene flake that controls the property of the cell walls.},

  abstract = {Carbon nanotube (CNT) has a great potential as membrane material for water distillation because of its smooth and hydrophobic surface. We numerically investigated the distillation performance of CNT membrane for direct contact membrane distillation using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation by varying diameters and lengths of the CNT and system operating conditions such as temperature, temperature difference between feed (hot) and permeate (cold) reservoirs, and sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration in the feed reservoir. It was found from the NEMD simulations that the distillation performance is enhanced by increasing system temperature, reservoir temperature difference, and CNT diameter, and decreasing CNT length, atomic attraction strength between water molecules and CNT, and NaCl concentration. The NEMD simulation overpredicts the water vapor transport by approximately an order of magnitude as compared with the results from the Knudsen diffusion model. The simulated flooding pressure is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction by the Young-Laplace equation using the MD-calculated contact angle. Most importantly, the permeability of the CNT membrane is two orders-of-magnitudes higher than a common polymer-based membrane made of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) due to almost two order-of-magnitude higher Knudsen diffusion of the CNT membrane than that of the PTFE membrane.},

  abstract = {While water is a key resource required to sustain life, freshwater sources and aquifers are being depleted at an alarming rate. As a mitigation strategy, saline water desalination is commonly used to supplement the available water resources beyond direct water supply. This is achieved through effective advanced water purification processes enabled to handle complex matrix of saline wastewater. Membrane technology has been extensively evaluated for water desalination. This includes the use of reverse osmosis (RO) (the most mature membrane technology for desalination), pervaporation (PV), electrodialysis (ED), membrane distillation (MD), and membrane crystallization (MCr). Though nanofiltration (NF) is not mainly applied for desalination purposes, it is included in the reviewed processes because of its ability to reach 90\% salt rejection efficiency for water softening. However, its comparison with other technologies is not provided since NF cannot be used for removal of NaCl during desalination. Remarkably, membrane processes remain critically affected by several challenges including membrane fouling. Moreover, capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) are the key factors influencing the establishment of water desalination processes. Therefore, this paper provides a concise and yet comprehensive review of the membrane processes used to desalt saline water. Furthermore, the successes and failures of each process are critically reviewed. Finally, the CAPEX and OPEX of these water desalination processes are reviewed and compared. Based on the findings of this review, MD is relatively comparable to RO in terms of process performance achieving 99\% salt rejections. Also, high salt rejections are reported on ED and PV. The operation and maintenance (O\&M) costs remain lower in ED. Notably, the small-scale MD OPEX falls below that of RO. However, the large-scale O\&M in MD is rarely reported due to its slow industrial growth, thus making RO the most preferred in the current water desalination markets.},

We call these ``Gel-SLIPS'' because the porous PVDF-HFP film fabricated using the NIPS process has been used as a gel electrolyte in a lithium-ion battery. In previous reports, SLIPS fabrication required complex processes, high annealing temperatures, and drying. Gel-SLIPS can be fabricated from the adjusted solution and the lubricant at room temperature and pressure in 5 min by squeegee, cast, or dip methods. NIPS is based on a quick phase separation process in situ, and reduction of the surface energy is not required because of the considerable fluorine in PVDF-HFP. Moreover, because of the flexible nanonetwork structure of PVDF-HFP, Gel-SLIPS exhibited self-standability and high transmittance ({$>$}87\% at 600 nm). Gel-SLIPS is thus highly versatile in terms of the fabrication process and film characteristics.},

  abstract = {The mechanical experience of consumption (i.e., feel, softness, and texture) of many foods is intrinsic to their enjoyable consumption, one example being the habit of twisting a sandwich cookie to reveal the cream. Scientifically, sandwich cookies present a paradigmatic model of parallel plate rheometry in which a fluid sample, the cream, is held between two parallel plates, the wafers. When the wafers are counterrotated, the cream deforms, flows, and ultimately fractures, leading to separation of the cookie into two pieces. We introduce Oreology (/Oriːˈɒl@dʒi/), from the Nabisco Oreo for ``cookie'' and the Greek rheo logia for ``flow study,'' as the study of the flow and fracture of sandwich cookies. Using a laboratory rheometer, we measure failure mechanics of the eponymous Oreo's ``creme'' and probe the influence of rotation rate, amount of creme, and flavor on the stress--strain curve and postmortem creme distribution. The results typically show adhesive failure, in which nearly allw (95\%) creme remains on one wafer after failure, and we ascribe this to the production process, as we confirm that the creme-heavy side is uniformly oriented within most of the boxes of Oreos. However, cookies in boxes stored under potentially adverse conditions (higher temperature and humidity) show cohesive failure resulting in the creme dividing between wafer halves after failure. Failure mechanics further classify the creme texture as ``mushy.'' Finally, we introduce and validate the design of an open-source, threedimensionally printed Oreometer powered by rubber bands and coins for encouraging higher precision home studies to contribute new discoveries to this incipient field of study.},

The spreading performance of physiological saline droplets on the surface of graphene under different NaCl concentrations and electric field intensities was studied in the present work. The results show that the increase in NaCl concentration reduces the displacement vector value of molecules in droplets. In addition, NaCl is easy to aggregate on the surface of graphene. The increase in NaCl concentration makes it more difficult for droplets to penetrate the surface of graphene, and the penetration angle of droplets increases with the rise in NaCl concentration. With the increase in electric field intensity, the wetting effect of droplets is more obvious. The greater the electric field intensity is, the smaller the penetration angle is, which is mainly due to the polarity of water molecules. This study has reference significance for the study of body fluid volatilization on the human surface.},

Herein, three-dimensional alkaline graphene aerogels are prepared and demonstrated to be highly efficient catalysts for H2S oxidation, achieving 3.19\,g/g of breakthrough capacity. Such high sulfur capacity is attributed to the interconnected graphene network consisting of graphene sheets, providing more product storehouse compared with traditional porous carbons. Further, a radical-induced reaction pathway of H2S oxidation is proposed that oxygen molecules could be activated to form superoxide radicals merely on graphene, which induces the dissociated HS- oxidation to sulfur. The characterization results also uncover that the formed sulfur goes through a process of nucleation and growth on graphene sheets. The current work could provide critical insights into the behavior of H2S oxidation and therefore offers a novel route of developing catalysts with large sulfur capacity at room temperature.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is a promising green technology that can harness waste or solar heat to treat water. Since such heat sources suffer from temporal variations, a complementary, efficient means is necessary. Induction heating is attractive in providing localized heating at the feed-membrane interface where the heat matters, but the typical conductive materials (e.g., metal, alloy) corrode readily in the high-salinity, high-temperature environment. In this work, a superior induction material was proposed, namely, reduced graphene oxides (rGO) coated onto a porous Nickel foam by Nafion (rGO/Nafion/Ni), which exhibited superior and sustained performance for membrane distillation. Results indicate that rGO/Nafion/Ni achieved up to 28.1\% higher water flux (6.42 {\textpm} 0.36 Lm 2h 1) and 37.5\% lower energy consumption (3.13 kWhL 1) compared to other carbon materials coated on Ni or the bare Ni foam. The mechanism underlying the enhanced MD performance was the higher absorption of the electromagnetic waves via multiple internal reflections and larger eddy currents generated by rGO, leading to higher temperatures at the feed-membrane interface that increased the driving force for distillation and thereby the energy efficiency of MD. Our work demonstrated that the induction heating of rGO has high potential for augmenting MD performance in water treatment.},

  abstract = {Brine, also known as concentrate, is the by-product of the desalination process that has an adverse impact on the environment due to its high salinity. Hence, viable and cost-effective brine management systems are needed to reduce environmental pollution. Currently, various disposal methods have been practiced, including surface water discharge, sewer discharge, deep-well injection, evaporation ponds and land application. However, these brine disposal methods are unsustainable and restricted by high capital costs and non-universal application. Nowadays, brine treatment is considered one of the most promising alternatives to brine disposal, since treatment results in the reduction of environmental pollution, minimization of waste volume and production of freshwater with high recovery. This review article evaluates current practices in brine management, including disposal methods and treatment technologies. Based upon the side-by-side comparison of technologies, a brine treatment technology framework is introduced to outline the Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) approach through high freshwater recovery and wastewater volume minimization. Furthermore, an overview of brine characteristics and its sources, as well as its negative impact on the environment is discussed. Finally, the paper highlights future research areas for brine treatment technologies aiming to enhance the effectiveness and viability of desalination.},

  abstract = {A Direct Contact Membrane Distillation system using a flat-sheet membrane module was fabricated to experimentally study the effects of operating conditions (inlet temperatures and flow rates of feed and permeate streams and salt concentration) on its distilled water production. A two-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model considering transmembrane mass flux and heat conduction and associated phase change heat transfer (evaporation and condensation) was developed. It was found that the computational predictions of distilled water production agreed well with the experimental measurements. Furthermore, the CFD model analyzed the effects of filament spacing of a screen spacer in the flow channels and flow configuration (counterflow and parallel) on the water distillation performance. In this study, it is concluded that high water distillation is achieved by using low permeate temperature, high feed temperature, high feed and permeate flow rates, and less salt concentration in a counterflow configuration. The water distillation is more influenced by the feed temperature than the permeate temperature due to the water saturation pressure-temperature relation. The simulation results also showed that the convection thermal resistances in the feed and permeate channels are decreased by using screen spacers and therefore, the temperature and concentration polarization effects are decreased in the channels.},

Here, we develop a new technique to simultaneously determine Tg and Xc by measuring the restitution of a ball on an intact polymer film or sheet as a function of temperature. Demonstrating with eight different types of polymers, we show that Tg is the onset of the decrease in restitution, and Xc is the minimum restitution for semi-crystalline polymers with Xc up to 50\%. Our simple yet versatile technique could provide a useful tool to measure challenging Tg and Xc of films and sheets by the conventional methods.},

Scaling occurred on a copper heat exchanger surface at temperatures set at between 40{$^\circ$} C and 60{$^\circ$} C. Changes in solution chemistry, zeta potential and particle size were also investigated. Scale deposits were analysed by scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that magnetic treatment had a significant effect on the precipitation/ deposition of calcium carbonate from solution under controlled physico-chemical conditions. Scaling was affected by the system temperature, pH and degree of supersaturation. The magnetic field was shown to influence significantly the zeta potential and particle size distribution of particles formed in solution, as well as the crystal morphology of the calcium carbonate deposits.

For all investigated models and state points we calculate the excess chemical potential for the noble gases and Methane.All water models exhibit too small hydration entropies, but show a clear hierarchy. TIP3P shows poorest agreement with experiment whereas TIP5P is closest to the experimental data at lower temperatures and SPCE is closest at higher temperatures. A rescaling procedure inspired by information theory model of Hummer et al. (\{{\textbackslash}em Chem.Phys.\}258, 349-370 (2000)) suggests that the differences between the different models and real water can be explained on the basis of the density curves at constant pressure. In addition, the models that give a good representation of the water structure at ambient conditions (TIP5P, SPCE and TIP4P) show considerably better agreement with the experimental data than SPC and TIP3P. We calculate the hydrophobic interaction between Xenon particles directly from a series of 60 ns simulation runs.We find that the temperature dependence of the association is related to the strength of the solvation entropy. Nevertheless, differences between the models seem to require a more detailed molecular picture.The TIP5P model shows by far the strongest temperature dependence.The suggested density-rescaling is also applied to the Xenon-Xenon contact-pair configuration, indicating the presence of a temperature where the hydrophobic interaction turns into purely repulsive.The predicted association for Xenon in real water suggest the presence a strong variation with temperature.},

Due to these characteristics, aerogels are emerging to be a popular material among the scientific community, since their discovery in 1931. However, their applicability has remained questionable due to the poor mechanical characteristics, such as brittleness and low tensile strength. In the last three decades, due to the rapid development in the computational resources and numerical methods, a deeper understanding of physical behavior and properties of these materials have been extensively investigated. In this work, an effort is made to critically analyze and categorize the computational models and simulation results available for silica, carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and cellulose aerogels. This work focused on a better understanding of how these materials were computationally modeled and simulated over the time-period and at different length-scales, wherein primary approaches, such as molecular dynamics (MD), coarse-grained, micromechanical multiscale and continuum mechanics modeling, were discussed. It also strives to give an insight into the areas where further computational studies are required, which could lead to numerous other application fields. The systematic review provides a mechanistic basis for reliable applications of aerogels.},

  abstract = {Silica aerogels are nanostructured, highly porous solids which have, compared to other soft materials, special mechanical properties, such as extremely low densities. In the present work, the mechanical properties of silica aerogels have been studied with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The aerogel model of 192\,000 atoms was created with different densities by direct expansion of {$\beta$}-cristobalite and subjected to series of thermal treatments. Because of the high number of atoms and improved modeling procedure, the proposed model was more stable and showed significant improvement in the smoothness of the resulting stress--strain curves in comparison to previous models. Resulting Poisson's ratio values for silica aerogels lie between 0.18 and 0.21. The elasticity moduli display a power law dependence on the density, with the exponent estimated to be 3.25 {\textpm} 0.1. These results are in excellent agreement with reported experimental as well as computational values. Two different deformation scenarios have been discussed. Under tension, the low-density aerogels were more ductile while the denser ones behaved rather brittle. In the compression simulations of low-density aerogels, deformation occurred without significant increase in stress. However, for high densities, atoms offer a higher resistance to the deformation, resulting in a more stiff response and an early densification. The relationship between different mechanical parameters has been found in the cyclic loading simulations of silica aerogels with different densities. The residual strain grows linearly with the applied strain ({$\geq$}0.16) and can be approximated by a phenomenological relation {$\epsilon$}p = 1.09{$\epsilon$}max -- 0.12. The dissipation energy also varies with the compressive strain according to a power law with an exponent of 2.31 {\textpm} 0.07. Moreover, the tangent modulus under cyclic loading varies exponentially with the compressive strain. The results of the study pave the way toward multiscale modeling of silica as well as reinforced silica aerogels.},

Therefore, the primary goal of the present work is to incorporate glass fibers, graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes into the silica aerogel matrix using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to improve not only the mechanical properties, e. g., tensile strength, elastic modulus, and toughness, but also the deformation characteristics due to the pre-existing cracks. This work investigates and compares the mechanical properties obtained from tension and compression tests of native silica aerogels and their nanocomposites. The results show that the axial and lateral direction mechanical properties of carbon-based nanocomposites are significantly higher than the native and glass fibers reinforced silica aerogels. For example, in the axial loading, the elastic modulus of the proposed glass fibers, graphene sheets, and carbon nanotubes reinforced nanocomposites were {$\sim$} 3.5, {$\sim$} 9.5 and {$\sim$} 11.5 times higher than the native silica aerogels, respectively. Moreover, the influence of crack depth has been studied in the tensile fracture simulations, and we found that in nanocomposites, the tensile load bearing candidates are mainly reinforced materials. The outcome of this work is a vital step in the process of designing advanced nanocomposites.},

In the present work, the mechanical properties and fracture behavior of graphene aerogels, which are highly brittle in nature, are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In tensile tests, elastic modulus and tensile strength exhibit a power law dependence on the density with their exponents predicted to be 2.95 {\textpm} 0.05 and 1.61 {\textpm} 0.04, respectively, which are in an excellent agreement with the reported works in the literature. In the compression simulations, Lennard-Jones contribution in the AIREBO potential is vital to predicting early densification. Moreover, in the compression loading--unloading simulations, as the density decreases, the dissipation energy increases. At the onset of the crack propagation, as the crack length to height ratio increases, the fracture strength decreased. However, for a considered range of the ratios, the fracture toughness values were nearly constant for all densities. Furthermore, the fracture toughness shows a power law dependence on the density, with the exponent estimated to be 1.41 {\textpm} 0.04.

The availability of a large number of functional groups, surface tunability, hydrophilicity, tensile strength and flexibility of nanocellulose (NC) makes it a potential candidate for aerogel preparation.

  abstract = {Graphene has attracted great interest for its excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal and optical properties. It can be produced by micro-mechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, epitaxial growth, chemical vapor deposition, and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The first three methods can produce graphene with a relatively perfect structure and excellent properties, while in comparison, GO has two important characteristics: (1) it can be produced using inexpensive graphite as raw material by cost-effective chemical methods with a high yield, and (2) it is highly hydrophilic and can form stable aqueous colloids to facilitate the assembly of macroscopic structures by simple and cheap solution processes, both of which are important to the large-scale uses of graphene. A key topic in the research and applications of GO is the reduction, which partly restores the structure and properties of graphene. Different reduction processes result in different properties of reduced GO (rGO), which in turn affect the final performance of materials or devices composed of rGO. In this contribution, we review the state-of-art status of the reduction of GO on both techniques and mechanisms. The development in this field will speed the applications of graphene.},

  abstract = {The power conversion efficiency of small-molecular-weight and polymer organic photovoltaic cells has increased steadily over the past decade. This progress is chiefly attributable to the introduction of the donor--acceptor heterojunction1,2 that functions as a dissociation site for the strongly bound photogenerated excitons. Further progress was realized in polymer devices through use of blends of the donor and acceptor materials3,4,5: phase separation during spin-coating leads to a bulk heterojunction that removes the exciton diffusion bottleneck by creating an interpenetrating network of the donor and acceptor materials. The realization of bulk heterojunctions using mixtures of vacuum-deposited small-molecular-weight materials has, on the other hand, posed elusive: phase separation induced by elevating the substrate temperature inevitably leads to a significant roughening of the film surface and to short-circuited devices. Here, we demonstrate that the use of a metal cap to confine the organic materials during annealing prevents the formation of a rough surface morphology while allowing for the formation of an interpenetrating donor--acceptor network. This method results in a power conversion efficiency 50 per cent higher than the best values reported for comparable bilayer devices, suggesting that this strained annealing process could allow for the formation of low-cost and high-efficiency thin film organic solar cells based on vacuum-deposited small-molecular-weight organic materials.},

The influence of mass transfer on heat transfer rates and on the heat transfer coefficient was identified, and the relative significance of each heat transfer mechanism was evaluated. The role of spacers in heat transfer improvement was analyzed. Alternative methods to evaluate the membrane thermal conductivity were also proposed. The heat transfer analysis of the experimental results showed that the effects of mass transfer on the heat transfer rates and on the film heat transfer coefficients were negligible. The heat transfer due to the vapor flow (qv) in the membrane was equal to or greater than the heat conduction (qc) for the membranes studied and increased with the feed temperature. When the feed temperature was lower than 323K, the heat loss due to heat conduction across the membrane was the major contribution of the total heat transfer in the membrane. In addition, the temperature distributions in the membranes were closely linear. The membrane distillation (MD) coefficients for each membrane were constant over the flow rates and temperatures studied. The flow pattern in the spacer-filled channel was probably transition flow rather than turbulent flow. The alternative models for calculating the membrane thermal conductivity showed better agreement than the commonly used model.},

Here, we use one such model as well as direct density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the phase equilibrium of water, hexagonal ice (Ih), and cubic ice (Ic), with an eye toward studying ice nucleation. The machine learning model is based on deep neural networks and has been trained on DFT data obtained using the SCAN exchange and correlation functional. We use this model to drive enhanced sampling simulations aimed at calculating a number of complex properties that are out of reach of DFT-driven simulations and then employ an appropriate reweighting procedure to compute the corresponding properties for the SCAN functional. This approach allows us to calculate the melting temperature of both ice polymorphs, the driving force for nucleation, the heat of fusion, the densities at the melting temperature, the relative stability of ices Ih and Ic, and other properties. We find a correct qualitative prediction of all properties of interest. In some cases, quantitative agreement with experiment is better than for state-of-the-art semiempirical potentials for water. Our results also show that SCAN correctly predicts that ice Ih is more stable than ice Ic.},

  abstract = {The removal of water-soluble organics from aqueous feeds is required in numerous practical applications, including bioresource processing, fermentation, and wastewater treatment. To this end, direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) has been proposed as a separation technology. DCMD utilizes hydrophobic membranes -- typically, comprising perfluorocarbons -- which, when placed between a warm feed and a cold permeate, prevent mixing due to the robust entrapment of air inside the (membranes') pores. Thus, the membranes allow only pure water vapor to transport across, following the thermal gradient. Here, we assessed DCMD for separating organics from aqueous feeds in light of organic fouling by utilizing ethanol and perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS) as the surrogate organic and hydrophobic coating, respectively. We investigated the adsorption of ethanol onto FDTS-grafted surfaces and membranes exposed to alcohol-water mixtures. Using the surface force apparatus, we found that the magnitude of hydrophobic forces between ultra-smooth FDTS-grafted mica surfaces in water-alcohol mixtures decreased with the increasing alcohol content. To simulate a practical DCMD scenario, we utilized FDTS-grafted polycarbonate membranes to separate a pure water reservoir from another containing 0.6~M NaCl and alcohol. For the 0\% alcohol case, the membranes robustly separated the reservoirs for over a week, whereas even for {$\geq$}0.1\% ethanol content, the membranes leaked within {$<$}5~h. After the leakage, the membranes' hydrophobicity could not be recovered by rinsing them with pure water and blow-drying; a heat treatment at 363~K for 1~h proved to be successful, however. Our molecular dynamics simulations revealed that ethanol molecules in water got preferentially stabilized at the interfaces of water and hydrophobic surfaces. Furthermore, this stabilization is significantly enhanced at higher alcohol concentrations due to the emergence of II-D interfacial networks comprising adsorbed alcohol molecules. Thus, this micro to macro-scale assessment demonstrates that DCMD with hydrophobic membranes is not suitable for separating organics from water, even at low alcohol concentrations. We also compare the efficacies of apparent advancing and receding contact angles towards a reliable characterization of fouled surfaces.},

The expansive force results from ``crystallization pressure'' which is a result of the interaction between the solid product of a chemical reaction, e.g. ettringite, and the cement paste. Two conditions are necessary for the occurrence of crystallization pressure: (1). Confined crystal growth of the solid product. (2). ``Activity product'' of reactants in the pore solution is greater than the ``solubility product'' of the solid product under atmospheric pressure.},

  abstract = {Scaling and biofouling are two major problems in the operation of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. A variety of control measures are employed in practice, including the use of pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMF), which can avoid the use of chemical anti-fouling agents (e.g. halogen-based biocides) that may be toxic to humans or the environment. This is a fairly recent and controversial technology and, from the available documentation and literature, it is clear that the scientific basis for its purported effectiveness is not yet firmly established, although some studies suggest that beneficial effects could be possible. In particular, the various conditions under which EMF technologies are likely to be effective for real world applications have not been scientifically established. This review collates the relevant literature on the problem of scaling and biofouling in RO membranes and heat exchangersystems (e.g. cooling towers), with a particular focus on the application of pulsed EMF technologies, including the broad documentation, relevant scientific studies, proposed mechanisms of action and further research directions. This review demonstrates that a lot more systematic scientific research is needed in order to validate the application and commercialization of EMF technologies as a pretreatment to control fouling in RO membrane systems.},

The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently---those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

The static test experiment verified that the Ca2+ retention efficiency ({$\eta$}) of NaCl on CaCO3 scale increased from 31.06\% (3.5 wt. \%) to 41.56\% (14 wt. \%). Based on the calculation of supersaturation rations, the high concentration of NaCl could reduce the activity coefficients of [Ca2+] and [CO32-], thus reducing the actual concentration of CaCO3. The CaCO3 deposition rate constants (k) showed that NaCl slowed down the rate of CaCO3 crystallization. The X--ray diffraction (XRD) testing disclosed that the growth of (1 0 4) and (1 1 0) faces from calcite was impeded, while the formation of (1 1 1) face from aragonite was induced by the increasing concentration of NaCl. The inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP--OES) results indicated that Na+ could be doped into CaCO3, leading to the one--dimensional crystal growth. It was further proved that NaCl heightens the efficiency of the typical phosphate inhibitors (2--phosphonobutane--1,2,4--tricarboxylic acid (PBTCA) and 1--hydroxyethane--1,1--diphosphonic acid (HEDP)) on prohibiting the scale of CaCO3.},

  abstract = {Thermal conduction in porous media has received wide attention in science and engineering in the past decades. Previous models of the effective thermal conductivity of porous media contain empirical parameters typically with ambiguous or even no physical rationales. This study proposes a theoretical model of effective thermal conductivity in porous media with various liquid saturation based on the fractal geometry theory. This theoretical model considers geometrical parameters of porous media, including porosity, liquid saturation, fractal dimensions for both the granular matrix and liquid phases, and tortuosity fractal dimension of the liquid phase. Effects of these geometrical parameters on the effective thermal conductivity of porous media are also evaluated. This proposed fractal model has been validated using published experimental data, compared with previous models, and thus provides a physics-based theoretical model that can provide insight to geoscience and thermophysics studies on thermal conduction in porous media.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) graphene assembly have shown how we can make solid porous materials that are lighter than air. It is plausible that these solid materials can be mechanically strong enough for applications under extreme conditions, such as being a substitute for helium in filling up an unpowered flight balloon. However, knowledge of the elastic modulus and strength of the porous graphene assembly as functions of its structure has not been available, preventing evaluation of its feasibility. We combine bottom-up computational modeling with experiments based on 3D-printed models to investigate the mechanics of porous 3D graphene materials, resulting in new designs of carbon materials. Our study reveals that although the 3D graphene assembly has an exceptionally high strength at relatively high density (given the fact that it has a density of 4.6\% that of mild steel and is 10 times as strong as mild steel), its mechanical properties decrease with density much faster than those of polymer foams. Our results provide critical densities below which the 3D graphene assembly starts to lose its mechanical advantage over most polymeric cellular materials.},

In this study, we report a nanoparticle-free strategy to fabricate omniphobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibrous membranes for robust MD desalination. A solvent-thermal induced roughening method was used to create multiscale hierarchical nanofin structures on electrospun PVDF nanofibers, followed by a polydopamine-anchored surface fluorination treatment to reduce the surface energy of the nanofibrous membrane. We show that the as-prepared membrane exhibited super repellence ({$>$}150{$^\circ$}) to diverse liquids with surface tension ranging from 73 to 30~mN~m-1. Moreover, the omniphobic membrane maintained stable salt rejection and water flux in direct contact MD processes in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant (up to 0.4~mM) or mineral oil (up to 480~mg~L-1), demonstrating its promising potential in practical water reclamation from MD applications.},

However, existing graphene foams with extremely low density are generally found to have very poor mechanical resilience. It is scientifically intriguing but remains unresolved whether and how the density limit of this class of cellular materials can be further pushed down while their mechanical resilience is being retained. In this work, a simple annealing strategy is developed to investigate the role of intersheet interactions in the formation of extreme-low-density of graphene-based cellular materials. It is discovered that the density limit of mechanically resilient cellular GEs can be further pushed down as low as 0.16 mg cm-3 through thermal annealing. The resultant extremely low density GEs reveal a range of unprecedented properties, including complete recovery from 98\% compression in both of liquid and air, ultrahigh solvent adsorption capacity, ultrahigh pressure sensitivity, and light transmittance.},

Flux decline caused by combined scaling and fouling was compared with those by individual scaling or fouling. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme (LYZ), two proteins with opposite charges at typical feedwater pH, were used as model protein foulants. Our results demonstrate that water flux decline was synergistically enhanced when silica and protein were both present in the feedwater. For example, flux decline after 500 min was far greater in combined silica scaling and BSA fouling experiments (55 {\textpm} 6\% decline) than those caused by silica (11 {\textpm} 2\% decline) or BSA (9 {\textpm} 1\% decline) alone. Similar behavior was observed with silica and LYZ, suggesting that this synergistic effect was independent of protein charge. Membrane characterization by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed distinct foulant layers formed by BSA and LYZ in the presence of silica. A combination of dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy , and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses further suggested that BSA and LYZ facilitated the formation of aggregates with varied chemical compositions. As a result, BSA and LYZ were likely to play different roles in enhancing flux decline in combined scaling and fouling. Our study suggests that the coexistence of organic foulants, such as proteins, largely alters scaling behavior of silica, and that accurate prediction of RO performance requires careful consideration of foulant-scalant interactions.},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract The paper is about cellular automaton models in materials science. It gives an introduction to the fundamentals of cellular automata and reviews applications, particularly for those that predict recrystallization phenomena. Cellular automata for recrystallization are typically discrete in time, physical space, and orientation space and often use quantities such as dislocation density and crystal orientation as state variables. Cellular automata can be defined on a regular or nonregular two- or three-dimensional lattice considering the first, second, and third neighbor shell for the calculation of the local driving forces. The kinetic transformation rules are usually formulated to map a linearized symmetric rate equation for sharp grain boundary segment motion. While deterministic cellular automata directly perform cell switches by sweeping the corresponding set of neighbor cells in accord with the underlying rate equation, probabilistic cellular automata calculate the switching probability of each lattice point and make the actual decision about a switching event by evaluating the local switching probability using a Monte Carlo step. Switches are in a cellular automaton algorithm generally performed as a function of the previous state of a lattice point and the state of the neighboring lattice points. The transformation rules can be scaled in terms of time and space using, for instance, the ratio of the local and the maximum possible grain boundary mobility, the local crystallographic texture, the ratio of the local and the maximum-occurring driving forces, or appropriate scaling measures derived from a real initial specimen. The cell state update in a cellular automaton is made in synchrony for all cells. The review deals, in particular, with the prediction of the kinetics, microstructure, and texture of recrystallization. Couplings between cellular automata and crystal plasticity finite element models are also discussed.},

Next, a designed feed-forward convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained based on the dataset to estimate several morphological, hydraulic, electrical, and mechanical characteristics of the porous material in a fraction of a second. In order to fine-tune the CNN design, we tested 9 different training scenarios and selected the one with the highest average coefficient of determination (R-2) equal to 0.885 for 1418 testing samples. Additionally, 3 independent synthetic images as well as 3 realistic tomography images have been tested using the proposed method and results are compared with pore network modelling and experimental data, respectively. Tested absolute permeabilities had around 13\% relative error compared to the experimental data which is noticeable considering the accuracy of the direct numerical simulation methods such as Lattice Boltzmann and Finite Volume. The workflow is compatible with any physical size of the images due to its dimensionless approach and can be used to characterize large-scale 3-D images by averaging the model outputs for a sliding window that scans the whole geometry.},

Experimental determination of liquid entry pressure (LEP) of a commercial Durapore\textsuperscript{TM} GVPH flat sheet membrane using model emulsions in various oil concentrations has been carried out. Two different methods of liquid entry pressure determination - a frequently used, so-called static and a novel dynamic method - have been investigated. In case of static method, LEP value was found to be 2.3 bar. No significant effect of oil content on LEP was detected up to 3200 ppm. In contrast, LEP values determined with dynamic method showed strong dependence on the oil concentration of the feed and decreased from 2.0 bar to a spontaneous wetting at 0.2 bar in the range 0-250 ppm, respectively. Vacuum membrane distillation tests were also performed. The separation performance is evaluated in terms of flux behavior, total organic carbon removal and droplet size distribution of the feed and final retentate. No significant effect of oil content on the flux was found (5.05 {\textpm} 0.31 kgm\textsuperscript{-2}h-1) up to 250 ppm, where a spontaneous wetting occurred. High separation performance was achieved along with the increasing oil concentration between 93.4-97.0\%.},

Moreover, receding contact angles were also measured for the probe liquids, and then applying the contact angle hysteresis (CAH) approach very recently proposed by Chibowski, the total surface free energy for these solids was calculated. Although the thus determined total surface free energy for a particular solid was expected to depend on the combination of three probe liquids used (LWAB approach), as well as on the kind of the liquid used (CAH approach), surprisingly the average values of the surface free energy from the two approaches agreed very well.

Antagonistic gypsum and calcium carbonate scaling kinetics were demonstrated for high-sulfate brackish water desalting. RO scaling studies with brackish water from the California San Joaquin Valley ({$\sim$}10\,000 mg/L total dissolved solids) revealed that membrane gypsum scaling was increasingly retarded with rising bicarbonate concentrations. Crystal growth rate, fractional membrane scale coverage, and flux decline decreased by up to about 63, 78, and 73\%, respectively, as the bicarbonate concentration increased, at the membrane surface, from {$<$}0.01 to 7.81 mM, for a gypsum saturation index of 2. Inhibition of gypsum crystal growth was attributed to bicarbonate adsorption onto the crystal surfaces, and CaCO3 scaling was undetected even up to a calcite saturation index of {$\sim$}16. Given the suppression of gypsum scaling by bicarbonate, it is essential to consider this effect in the conventional practice of pH adjustment to suppress CaCO3 scaling. The present results suggest that antagonistic and synergistic mineral crystallization kinetics effects are important for optimizing scale-control strategies (e.g., acid and antiscalants addition to the RO feed).},

However, the mass transport through membranes is commonly described by nonlinear differential-algebraic mechanistic models at the nano-scale, while the process and its economics range up to large-scale. Thus, the optimal design of membranes in process plants requires decision making across multiple scales, which is not possible using standard tools. In this work, we embed artificial neural networks (ANNs) as surrogate models in the deterministic global optimization to bridge the gap of scales. This methodology allows for deterministic global optimization of membrane processes with accurate transport models -- avoiding the utilization of inaccurate approximations through heuristics or short-cut models. The ANNs are trained based on data generated by a one-dimensional extended Nernst-Planck ion transport model and extended to a more accurate two-dimensional distribution of the membrane module, that captures the filtration-related decreasing retention of salt. We simultaneously design the membrane and plant layout yielding optimal membrane module synthesis properties along with the optimal plant design for multiple objectives, feed concentrations, filtration stages, and salt mixtures. The developed process models and the optimization solver are available open-source, enabling computational resource-efficient multi-scale optimization in membrane science.},

Solar desalination could be an ideal solution for isolated areas which receive high solar irradiation per day. Solar Membrane Distillation (MD) is a developing technology particularly interesting for small supplies, isolated populations and autonomous systems. As it is a low temperature operation process. MD is very suitable for integration with thermal solar systems and/or waste heat recovery units; in contrast to other desalination technologies, only a coarse filtration of the water is required as pretreatment. However, the commercial availability is currently quite limited. This paper presents the promising 5-year experience and data analysis of a solar compact MD demonstration plant installed in the facilities of the Instituto Tecnologico de Canarias (ITC) in Playa de Pozo Izquierdo (Gran Canary Island-Spain). The unit was designed and installed at the end of 2004 as part of a co-funded FP6 DGTREN research project called 'Development of stand-alone, solar thermally driven and PV-supplied desalination systems based on innovative membrane distillation' (MEMDIS) and has been continuously tested within the FP7 EU co-funded project called 'MEmbrane Distillation in Remote AreaS - MEDIRAS'.

  abstract = {The growth of mineral crystals on surfaces is a challenge across multiple industrial processes. Membrane-based desalination processes, in particular, are plagued by crystal growth (known as scaling), which restricts the flow of water through the membrane, can cause membrane wetting in membrane distillation, and can lead to the physical destruction of the membrane material. Scaling occurs when supersaturated conditions develop along the membrane surface due to the passage of water through the membrane, a process known as concentration polarization. To reduce scaling, concentration polarization is minimized by encouraging turbulent conditions and by reducing the amount of water recovered from the saline feed. In addition, antiscaling chemicals can be used to reduce the availability of cations. Here, we report on an energy-efficient electrophoretic mixing method capable of nearly eliminating CaSO4 and silicate scaling on electrically conducting membrane distillation (ECMD) membranes. The ECMD membrane material is composed of a percolating layer of carbon nanotubes deposited on porous polypropylene support and cross-linked by poly(vinyl alcohol). The application of low alternating potentials (2 Vpp,1Hz) had a dramatic impact on scale formation, with the impact highly dependent on the frequency of the applied signal, and in the case of silicate, on the pH of the solution.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is a burgeoning membrane technology that has gained immense interest among membrane scientists worldwide. Despite a slow start, both the theoretical and experimental researches on MD, especially on desalination applications, have escalated significantly over the past few decades. Although the large-scale use of MD has not proliferated worldwide, the researches done thus far have helped us to understand the rudiments of MD and explore the potential areas capable of enhancing its commercial attractiveness. Membranes of very high quality, nearing the properties of an ideal membrane, will fuel the growth of this technology. An ideal membrane for MD is expected to have features such as high liquid entry pressure, low fouling rate, low thermal conductivity, high permeability and excellent mechanical strength. In that regard, ceramic membranes have been appreciated for their high tolerance to harsh conditions, however, their high cost has rendered them less favourable commercially. Polymeric membranes are seen as a plausible cheaper alternative and have dominated research done thus far on MD. This review aims to give a brief introduction to MD and a summary of the research efforts to acquire the desired properties in polymeric membranes used in MD for desalination purposes. Potential research directions are highlighted too.},

The PVA layer acted as base layer absorbing the condensed vapor and thus enhancing the vapor flux across the membrane. The hybrid three-layered membrane exhibited superhydrophobicity, with an average contact angle of more than 160{$^\circ$}, and demonstrated high performance in terms of rejection and water flux. This study also examined the pore size distribution, surface roughness, surface area, tensile strength, water flux, and salt rejection of the fabricated membrane. The salt rejection level was calculated to be 99.7\%, and a high permeate flux of approximately 6.7 LMH was maintained for 16 h.},

  abstract = {Selection of a proper osmotic agent is important to make the forward osmosis (FO) feasible. The objective of this study was to enhance FO by lowering reverse solute flux and maintaining high water flux. Poly(propylene glycol) with molecular weight of 725 Da (PPG-725) was found to possess high osmolality, making it a strong candidate for using as a draw agent. In addition, to reduce the partial leakage of draw solute, a non-ionic surfactant (Triton X-114) has been incorporated. Typically, when the hydrophobic tails of Triton X-114 interacted with the membrane surface, a layer on the surface of membrane is produced to constrict the pores and thus minimize the reverse solute flux. In this study, different concentrations of PPG-725 incorporated with different concentrations of Triton X-114 (0.2e0.8 mM) were used to evaluate their osmotic potentials as draw solute. The specific reverse solute flux (Js/Jw) of 40\% PPG-725 doped with Triton X-114 was found to be 0.01 g/L, considerably much lesser than the conventional inorganic draw agents. Finally, membrane distillation operation was utilized as the recovery system in which solute rejection of 97\% was achieved for 40\% PPG-725/Triton X-114. Therefore, the overall performance supported PPG-725/Triton X-114 as being an efficient draw agent for forward osmosis-membrane distillation hybrid process.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of droplet condensation--evaporation behavior on fibers is important for improving the performance of fibrous membranes that are used in water purification applications, e.g., Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD). DCMD is a promising method of purifying water when low-grade waste heat or renewable energies are available. However, DCMD suffers from low throughput mass flux, and it is also prone to membrane flooding. We used molecular dynamics simulations in this work as the conventional (experimental or computational) methods do not have the required atomistic resolution to reveal the dynamics of water condensation--evaporation on the surface of fibers. Our simulations indicate that vapor flux across the membrane remains constant (with no droplet formation on the fiber) when the fibers' Young--Laplace Contact Angle (YLCA) is greater than a critical value at which condensation is suppressed. However, mass flux decreases with time at lower YLCAs due to the formation and growth of water droplets on the fibers, which could ultimately lead to membrane flooding. We also studied the impact of feed temperature, permeate temperature, fiber diameter, fiber position, and domain size on the fiber critical YLCA. Optimizing these parameters allows the use of a wide array of materials in membrane fabrication, including even hydrophilic materials, while preventing membrane flooding and also enhancing mass flux. In this work, we also present a novel methodology to simulate steady-state droplet condensation--evaporation process in the framework of molecular dynamics simulation, i.e., simulation times {$>\sim$}10~ns, in contrast to the quasi-steady-state simulations (simulation time {$<\sim$}2 ns) reported in most previous studies. Our work demonstrates a simulation platform to study the dynamics of the water condensation--evaporation on fibers and can be used to guide the design of DCMD membranes.},

  abstract = {Superhydrophobic membrane for the application in membrane distillation was generated by creating a hierarchical structure with multilevel roughness via depositing TiO2 nanoparticles on microporous PVDF membranes by means of a low temperature hydrothermal (LTH) process. The TiO2 coated membranes were then fluorosilanized using a low surface energy material H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorododecyltrichlorosilane. A variety of techniques such as capillary flow porometry, TEM, SEM, XPS, KI test, liquid entry pressure (LEP) measurement and contact angle goniometry were applied to explore the effects of surface modification on the surface chemistry, structure and performance of the membranes. The anti-fouling performance of virgin and modified membranes were examined in a direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) process using sodium chloride and humic acid solution as a model feed. Results showed that the modification was mechanically and thermally robust and photoactive. The liquid entry pressure (LEP) and water contact angle were increased from 120 kPa and 1251 to 190 kPa and 1661, respectively. The fluorosilanization of TiO2 nanocomposite PVDF membranes did not compromise the mean pore size. It was also appeared that the TiO2 coating not only contributes in engineering the hierarchical structure but also provides sites (OH functional groups) for the hydrolyzed silane coupling agent to be anchored forming a robust uniform water repellent film. The filtration results also showed that the pure water flux of the modified membrane was lower than that of the virgin membrane particularly at higher temperatures. However, the sodium chloride DCMD test showed that the permeate conductivity of the virgin membrane was increased sharply whereas it was not changed for the modified membrane over the period of the experiment. A 20 h fouling DCMD experiment with humic acid did not show a reduction in flux for virgin and modified membranes. However, a substantial reduction in flux was observed with the addition of 3.775 mM CaCl2 into the solution due to the formation of complexes with humic acid and consequent particles coagulation and precipitation on the membrane surface. Although both virgin and modified membranes showed similar fouling behaviors, a significantly higher flux recovery was found for modified membrane compared to the virgin membrane.},

In many applications, e.g. learning with large output spaces, it has been empirically observed that these algorithms fail to converge to an optimal solution (or a critical point in nonconvex settings). We show that one cause for such failures is the exponential moving average used in the algorithms. We provide an explicit example of a simple convex optimization setting where Adam does not converge to the optimal solution, and describe the precise problems with the previous analysis of Adam algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the convergence issues can be fixed by endowing such algorithms with `long-term memory' of past gradients, and propose new variants of the Adam algorithm which not only fix the convergence issues but often also lead to improved empirical performance.},

This means that both precipitation and phase changes between a water-vapour phase (outside a cloud) and a water-vapour-plus-liquid phase (inside a cloud) are taken into account. In the dry case, provided that a Laplace equation is inverted, the quasi-geostrophic equations may be formulated as a nonlocal transport equation for a single scalar variable (the potential vorticity). In the case of the precipitating quasi-geostrophic equations, inverting the Laplacian is replaced by a more challenging adversary known as potential-vorticity-and-moisture inversion. The PDE to invert is nonlinear and piecewise elliptic with jumps in its coefficients across the cloud edge. However, its global ellipticity is a priori unclear due to the dependence of the phase boundary on the unknown itself. This is a free boundary problem where the location of the cloud edge is one of the unknowns. Potential vorticity-and-moisture inversion differs from oft-studied free-boundary problems in the literature, and here we present the first rigorous analysis of this PDE. Introducing a variational formulation of the inversion, we use tools from the calculus of variations to deduce existence and uniqueness of solutions and de Giorgi techniques to obtain sharp regularity results. In particular, we show that the gradient of the unknown pressure or streamfunction is H{\textbackslash}"older continuous at cloud edge.},

  abstract = {The membrane distillation process is one of the most important membrane technologies being developed for water desalination, which has the ability to compete with expensive processes such as reverse osmosis. In this study, the performance of polycarbonate (PC) hollow fiber membranes modified with silica aerogel nanoparticles (SIA-NPs) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coating solution for direct contact membrane distillation was investigated. The membranes were fabricated by dry jet-wet spinning method. In this respect, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 wt\% of SIA nanoparticles were coated over the hollow fiber surface in order to improve the performance of the membranes. The results indicated that the optimum loading of SIA was 0.5 wt\% at which the contact angle of the surface shifted from 77.5{$^\circ$} to 100{$^\circ$} relative to the unmodified PC membrane. Although the addition of SIA nanoparticles to the membrane matrix did not alter the membrane conductivity, it increased the membrane thickness, thereby reduced the heat loss of the membrane. Accordingly, the results of performance tests for the membrane distillation (MD) showed that by adding 0.5\% SIA nanoparticles to the membrane bulk and coating the surface with 0.5\% SIA nanoparticles in 1.0\% PDMS solution and 96\% increase in energy efficiency, 33\% increase in water flux, as well as higher stability of salt rejection were obtained. This study proved that the application of SIA nanoparticles have a great potential to modify and improve MD performance.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is a rapidly emerging water treatment technology; however, membrane pore wetting is a primary barrier to widespread industrial use of MD. The primary causes of membrane wetting are exceedance of liquid entry pressure and membrane fouling. Developments in membrane design and the use of pretreatment have provided significant advancement toward wetting prevention in membrane distillation, but further progress is needed. In this study, a broad review is carried out on wetting incidence in membrane distillation processes. Based on this perspective, the study describes the wetting mechanisms, wetting causes, and wetting detection methods, as well as hydrophobicity measurements of MD membranes. This review discusses current understanding and areas for future investigation on the influence of operating conditions, MD configuration, and membrane non-wettability characteristics on wetting phenomena. Additionally, the review highlights mathematical wetting models and several approaches to wetting control, such as membrane fabrication and modification, as well as techniques for membrane restoration in MD. The literature shows that inorganic scaling and organic fouling are the main causes of membrane wetting. The regeneration of wetting MD membranes is found to be challenging and the obtained results are usually not favorable. Several pretreatment processes are found to inhibit membrane wetting by removing the wetting agents from the feed solution. Various advanced membrane designs are considered to bring membrane surface non-wettability to the states of superhydrophobicity and superomniphobicity; however, these methods commonly demand complex fabrication processes or high-specialized equipment. Recharging air in the feed to maintain protective air layers on the membrane surface has proven to be very effective to prevent wetting, but such techniques are immature and in need of significant research on design, optimization, and pilot-scale studies.},

We employ molecular dynamics simulations to study the crystallization kinetics of a nearly hard sphere liquid that is weakly sheared. We demonstrate that shear flow both enhances and suppresses the crystallization kinetics of hard spheres. The effect of shear depends on the quiescent mechanism: suppression in the activated regime and enhancement in the diffusion-limited regime for small strain rates. At higher strain rates crystallization again becomes an activated process even at densities close to the glass transition.},

These are the osmotic pressure of the feedwater, the feedwater temperature, the water recovery, and the relationship between the water flux and salt flux characteristics of the membrane. In addition, the required permeate quality may have several indirect effects on the energy consumption. Permeate quality standards may impose minimum operating pressures, limit the recovery, and/or require treatment with a full or partial second stage. As a general rule, the energy required increases with increasing feed salinity and increasing permeate quality. For any given recovery, a single stage system will require less energy than a partial two stage system. However, for a specified permeate quality, a partial two stage system can operate at a higher overall recovery and a lower energy consumption than a single stage system Energy recovery systems can recover between 50 and 90 percent of the available energy in a reverse osmosis unit, thus significantly lowering the energy consumption. Studies have shown that with an energy recovery system, the minimum energy consumption occurs at a first stage recovery of 30 to 35 percent. Currently, very few energy recovery systems are in use due to their high capital cost, but as energy recovery systems become more available and reliable, they will greatly increase the energy efficiency of reverse osmosis plants.},

The interfacial free energy of nucleation for heterogeneous processes is simply related to the relative nucleus-solvent and nucleus-surface areas and their individual interfacial free energies. VCG theory is used to extend this relationship to the individual surface free energies of the isolated phases. Surface free energies obtained from, for example, surface tension measurements and surface probe contact-angle measurements provide independent measure of the needed quantities. We use classical nucleation theory and VCG theory to connect the two types of experiments and allow prediction of how various types of surfaces may induce the heterogeneous nucleation in various solvents. A variety of examples are discussed that illuminate the important surface properties relevant to heterogeneous nucleation. This approach allows a rational design of surfaces to either promote or inhibit precipitate formation.},

Porosity is in excess of 90\%, in some cases as high as 99.9\%, and densities can be as low as 3 kg/m3. Aerogels are essentially `puffed-up sand' and are often termed `frozen smoke'. Their thermal conductivity (0.014 W/m K at room temperature) is the lowest of any solids, and they also have good transparency. The acoustic properties of aerogels make them effective insulators against noise, and aerogels have the lowest refractive index, and dielectric constant of all solid materials. The unusual properties of aerogels open the way to a new range of opportunities for their application in buildings. This paper provides information on their unique features and reviews the potential applications for aerogels in buildings as well as latest developments in the field.},

In a given deposit, the density of nuclei increased with time to a well defined saturation value, the approach to this value being monotonic and of approximately exponential form. In general, the nucleation rate at constant temperature was observed to be proportional to the square of the atom arrival rate, indicating that a pair of adsorbed atoms constitutes a stable nucleus. The saturation density of nuclei was observed to increase as the atom arrival rate increased or as the temperature decreased. It is shown that existing theories, which have not previously been fully tested, are inadequate to explain the features observed. The source of this inadequacy is discussed and the basis of a more successful theory is proposed.}

The data are in the form of nucleation rates and saturation densities as functions of atom arrival rates and substrate temperatures. A theoretical treatment of nucleation and growth kinetics, based on simplified assumptions, is developed for the one atom critical nucleus case and analytical expressions are obtained which apply over wide ranges of deposition conditions. This theory is then applied to the analysis of the new experimental data and previously published data for gold on KCl and NaF. The results offer experimental support for the generally accepted concepts that the kinetics are determined by the adatom concentration on the surface, that the kinetics are distinctly different for at least two distinguishable sets of deposition conditions, and that coalescence plays an important role in thin film growth. Values for the adsorption energy and the activation energy for surface diffusion of gold on each of the four crystal surfaces mentioned are presented and their reliability is discussed.}

We also describe the effect of specific interaction of functional group of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with water moisture on the enhancement of water vapor flux in DCMD via alteration of polar--non polar nature of membrane surface. The incorporation of carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional group on carbon nanotubes alters the hydrophilic--hydrophobic interaction of water moistures with the membrane surface that provides additional pathway for enhanced water vapor transport. The water vapor flux was obtained 36.8kg/m2h at 70{$^\circ$}C for CNT--COOH--PP, which is 51.5\% higher than unmodified polypropylene membrane at salt concentration 10,000ppm in feed. The salt rejection was found greater than 99.9\% at salt concentration 10,000ppm in feed solution. An increase in mass transfer coefficient about 1.5 times was also observed for CNT--COOH--PP membrane. The CNIM also exhibits higher thermal stability at elevated temperatures.},

This review summarizes the research history and the latest progress of ITR in thermally conductive polymer composites from 4 aspects: mathematical models, computer simulations, measurement techniques and strategies to reduce ITR.

This water model has an anomalously high dielectric constant and low viscosity, which limits its accuracy in the calculation of quantities like permeability coefficients. The TIP3P-FB and TIP4P-FB water models are more accurate in terms of the dielectric constant and transport properties, which could allow more accurate simulations of systems containing water and lipids. To test whether the CHARMM36 lipid force field is compatible with the TIP3P-FB and TIP4P-FB water models, we have performed simulations of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayers. The calculated headgroup area, compressibility, order parameters, and X-ray form factors are in good agreement with the experimental values, indicating that these improved water models can be used with the CHARMM36 lipid force field without modification when calculating membrane physical properties. The water permeability predicted by these models is significantly different; the mTIP3P-model diffusion in solution and at the lipid--water interface is anomalously fast due to the spuriously low viscosity of mTIP3P-model water, but the potential of mean force of permeation is higher for the TIP3P-FB and TIP4P-FB models due to their high excess chemical potentials. As a result, the rates of water permeation calculated the FB water models are slower than the experimental value by a factor of 15--17, while simulations with the mTIP3P model only underestimate the water permeability by a factor of 3.},

  abstract = {Recently, the scientific community has become more interested in solar-driven steam materials and systems for desalination and disinfection. Solar thermal energy for membrane distillation desalination provides a green and sustainable option for building settings where there is a strong connection between water constraint and high solar irradiation. Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly being used to optimize water treatments and saltwater desalination because of its high precision and accuracy. Explainable AI (XAI) enables people to better understand and trust a model's predictions and to detect and rectify inaccurate AI predictions. This study analyses recent advances in solar-driven steam materials engineering and the significant technological constraints that impede its wide-scale deployment. Using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), our study provides an interpretable solution (in addition to the binary classification result of the developed black-box deep learning (DL) model) so that experts can understand why the machine thinks this way, providing critical insights for the decision-making process. The proposed XAI-DL model is based on a DL network consisting of three cascaded convolutional blocks for processing tabular data. Therefore, the XAI-DL classification model achieves a cooling quality accuracy of 82.64\% during the validation stage, supporting the explaining capability. During the testing, the [inlet-cooling-water-temperature] pushes the model lower, whereas the [ambient-temperature], [feed-water-flow-rate], and the [inlet-feed-water-temperature] pushes the model higher. The LIME explanation result is consistent with the statistical analysis of the data. Consequently, the proposed explainer assists non-experts in comparing and improving the untrustworthy model through and clarifies the importance of each feature and its relationship to other features and its relationship to the class. Finally, the XAI-DL fits and supports the different manufacturers of membrane desalination system(s) to inspect cooling quality in their designed system and consistency of interpretability and trust.},

  abstract = {Freshwater scarcity is a vital societal challenge related to climate change, population pressure, and agricultural and industrial demands. Therefore, sustainable desalination/purification of salty/contaminated water for human uses is particularly relevant. Membrane distillation is an emerging hybrid thermal-membrane technology with the potential to overcome the drawbacks of conventional desalination by a synergic exploitation of the water--energy nexus. Although membrane distillation is considered a green technology, efficient heat management remains a critical concern affecting the cost of the process and hindering its viability at large scale. A multidisciplinary approach that involves materials chemistry, physical chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials and polymer science is required to solve this problem. The combination of solar energy with membrane distillation is considered a potentially feasible low-cost approach for providing high-quality freshwater with a low carbon footprint. In particular, recent discoveries about efficient light-to-heat conversion in nanomaterials have opened unprecedented perspectives for the implementation of sunlight-based renewable energy in membrane distillation. The integration of nanofillers enabling photothermal effects into membranes has been demonstrated to be able to significantly enhance the energy efficiency without impacting on economic costs. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview on the state of the art, the opportunities, open challenges and pitfalls of the emerging field of solar-driven membrane distillation. We also assess the peculiar physicochemical properties and synthesis scalability of photothermal materials, as well as the strategies for their integration into polymeric nanocomposite membranes enabling efficient light-to-heat conversion and freshwater.},

  abstract = {The permeability of complex porous materials is of interest to many engineering disciplines. This quantity can be obtained via direct flow simulation, which provides the most accurate results, but is very computationally expensive. In particular, the simulation convergence time scales poorly as the simulation domains become less porous or more heterogeneous. Semi-analytical models that rely on averaged structural properties (i.e., porosity and tortuosity) have been proposed, but these features only partly summarize the domain, resulting in limited applicability. On the other hand, data-driven machine learning approaches have shown great promise for building more general models by virtue of accounting for the spatial arrangement of the domains' solid boundaries. However, prior approaches building on the convolutional neural network (ConvNet) literature concerning 2D image recognition problems do not scale well to the large 3D domains required to obtain a representative elementary volume (REV). As such, most prior work focused on homogeneous samples, where a small REV entails that the global nature of fluid flow could be mostly neglected, and accordingly, the memory bottleneck of addressing 3D domains with ConvNets was side-stepped. Therefore, important geometries such as fractures and vuggy domains could not be modeled properly. In this work, we address this limitation with a general multiscale deep learning model that is able to learn from porous media simulation data. By using a coupled set of neural networks that view the domain on different scales, we enable the evaluation of large ( {$>$} 5123) images in approximately one second on a single graphics processing unit. This model architecture opens up the possibility of modeling domain sizes that would not be feasible using traditional direct simulation tools on a desktop computer. We validate our method with a laminar fluid flow case using vuggy samples and fractures. As a result of viewing the entire domain at once, our model is able to perform accurate prediction on domains exhibiting a large degree of heterogeneity. We expect the methodology to be applicable to many other transport problems where complex geometries play a central role.},

Under equilibrium conditions, where the crystal is surrounded by a film of solution, high stresses are expected only in small pores, but when that film is discontinuous (as may occur during drying), high stresses can arise even in large pores. High crystallization pressure requires a substantial supersaturation of the pore liquid. In the case of sodium sulfate, supersaturation results from the difference in solubility between the anhydrate and decahydrate phases; for ettringite, supersaturation may develop following the cooling from elevated temperatures. During the hydration of Portland cement, crystallization pressure may result from the growth of ettringite and/or calcium hydroxide. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Despite the high thermal conductivity of isolated SWCNTs, the thermal conductivity of the evacuated aerogel is 0.025 {\textpm} 0.010 W m-1 K-1 at a temperature of 300 K. This very low value is a result of the high porosity and the low interface thermal conductance at the tube--tube junctions (estimated as 12 pW K-1). Thermal conductivity measurements and analysis of the gas-permeated aerogel (H2, He, Ne, N2, and Ar) show that gas molecules transport energy over length scales hundreds of times larger than the diameters of the pores in the aerogel. It is hypothesized that inefficient energy exchange between gas molecules and SWCNTs gives the permeating molecules a memory of their prior collisions. Low gas-SWCNT accommodation coefficients predicted by molecular dynamics simulations support this hypothesis.

The factors affecting flux are shown to be film heat transfer, membrane `thermal' permeability, the partial pressure of air within the pores and the presence of solute in the feed. Solute effects mainly influence vapour pressure and film transfer coefficients. Deaeration significantly increases gas phase permeability, but the effect on flux is modest due to increased temperature polarisation. MD of salt and sucrose solutions at concentrations up to 25 and 30\% respectively give fluxes of 60 to 70\% of that for a pure water feed. The flux reduction for salt is largely due to vapour pressure reduction, and for sucrose is due to increased viscosity.},

  abstract = {We estimate the crystallisation pressure of gypsum quantitatively, with reference to the geological context of the Gypsum Keuper formation. The formation contains sulphatic claystones which have the property of swelling in the presence of water and have caused substantial structural damage to the linings of several tunnels in Switzerland and Germany. The swelling of these rocks is attributed to the transformation of anhydrite into gypsum, which occurs via the dissolution of anhydrite in pore water and the precipitation of gypsum from the solution. This simultaneous dissolution--precipitation process happens because the solubility of gypsum is lower than that of anhydrite under the conditions prevailing after tunnelling, and it does not cease until all of the anhydrite has been transformed. The elementary mechanism behind the development of the macroscopically observed swelling pressure is the growth of gypsum crystals inside the rock matrix: If a crystal is in contact with a supersaturated solution, but its growth is prevented by the surrounding matrix, it then exerts a so-called crystallisation pressure upon the pore walls. In the present paper, the crystallisation pressure is calculated by means of a thermodynamic model that takes coherent account of all relevant parameters, including the chemical composition of the pore water and pore size. Variations in these parameters lead to a very wide range of crystallisation pressures (from zero to several tens of megapascals). By using the results of mercury intrusion porosimetry and chemical analyses of samples from three Swiss tunnels, however, we show that the range of predicted values can be reduced significantly with the help of standard, project-specific investigations.},

The literature contains a number of studies and research studies that aim to understand the behavior of membrane distillation systems and to provide the best possible solutions under different conditions. The purpose of this article is to discuss the air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) specifically and its development to date. The areas for future research in the field of AGMD are suggested. Membranes used in AGMD were discussed, including nanocomposite membranes and graphene membranes. In addition, the long-term performance issues regarding membrane fouling and scaling and the ways to prevent and to reduce them were discussed. Performance parameters that have not been explored sufficiently, such as energy efficiency and performance ratio, are discussed. Evolution of new membrane distillation processes from AGMD, such as the material gap and permeate gap, and conductive gap membrane distillation, is discussed. A generalized theoretical model for heat and mass transfer is presented for air gap membrane distillation systems. Coupling AGMD to form a hybrid combination with renewable energy sources is considered as a good answer to energy specific issues. Hybrid renewable energy systems with AGMD are discussed in detail. Novel designs for coupling AGMD systems with different forms of renewable energies are suggested, which presents an excellent area to be considered for developing advanced hybrid AGMD systems. It is suggested that future research should include economic studies, long-run system performance, operational problems and maintainance requirements, and related issues for better understanding and better acceptance of AGMD systems for industrialization.},

The various techniques used for retarding or eliminating scaling in evaporation units are reviewed in brief. The thermal decomposition of HCO3- is a kinetically controlled, first-order reaction. Like all rate reactions, it is prone to be catalyzed or decelerated by specific agents. Whilst catalysis by Ca2+ ions is well documented, inhibition has never been reported before. Three polymaleate compounds, commonly used as anti-scale agents, were discovered to inhibit HCO3- decomposition. The extent of inhibition depended on the nature and concentration of the additive used. The rate constants of the decomposition reaction were computed at 100{$^\circ$}C. The tested compounds were, however, relatively weak inhibitors. Inhibition of the thermal decomposition of HCO3- presents a novel approach to combat scale formation, hitherto not applied before. The present paper is a call for a search for better inhibitors, to be combined with polymers with dispersing activity, to obtain new anti-scale agents with powerful properties.},

  abstract = {This work presents an experimental study of dynamic contact angle hysteresis using liquid bridges under cyclic compression and stretching between two identical plates. Under various loading rates, contact angle hystereses for three different liquids were measured by examination of advancing and receding liquid bridges, and the capillary forces were recorded. It is found that for a given liquid, the hysteretic behaviour of the contact angle is more pronounced at higher loading rates. By unifying the behaviour of the three liquids, power-law correlations were proposed to describe the relationship between the dynamic contact angle and the capillary number for advancing and receding cases. It is found that the exponents of obtained power-law correlations differ from those derived through earlier methods (e.g., capillary rise), due to the different kinematics of the contact line. The various hysteretic loops of capillary force in liquid bridges under varied cyclic loading rates were also observed, which can be captured quantitatively by the prediction of our developed model incorporating the dynamic contact angle hysteresis. These results illustrate the importance of varying contact line geometries during dynamic wetting and dewetting processes, and warrant an improved modelling approach for higher level phenomena involving these processes, e.g., multiphase flow in porous media and liquid transfer between surfaces with moving contact lines.},

  abstract = {In the present work, poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) asymmetric microporous hollow fiber membranes were successfully fabricated using nonsolvent-induced phase inversion method which has not been reported previously. Analyses of thermodynamic characteristics of the PVDF-HFP/NMP/water system without/with PVP as an additive and the rheological property of the spinning dopes were carried out as a first step. Subsequently, the effects of spinning conditions (wet spinning, air gap, bore fluid composition), dope concentration and PVP addition on the resultant hollow fiber membranes were studied in terms of membrane morphology, structure, pure water flux and molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) as well as their hydrophobicity and mechanical properties. It was found that the wet spinning process produced hollow fibers with irregular inner contour under present experimental conditions. The strong viscoelastic property of PVDF-HFP material was thought to be associated with this phenomenon. A partial release of accumulated back stress in the nascent fibers might have caused the macromolecules to move inward in the transverse direction. Increasing the air gap could eliminate this inner contour deformation, as the outer surface of the nascent fiber was not vitrified prior to entering the water bath, thus allowing the orientated macromolecules to be relaxed. In addition, the nascent fiber is generally expected to experience an elongational stretch over the distance of the air gap, which might help to smooth the inner surface. Membranes made from the PVDF-HFP/NMP dopes were found to have small pure water fluxes no matter what the polymer concentration, the bore fluid composition and the air gap were used in the spinning processes. The pure water flux can be increased by adding PVP into the dope solution, up to 5 wt.\% PVP in the dope can promote the formation of macrovoids in the membrane. When the PVP content was increased to 10 wt.\%, the macrovoids were suppressed, but the membrane still presented a higher porosity, which was reflected from the significant increase in the pure water flux from 60 to 107 L/(h m(2) atm). In addition, PDVF-HFP hollow fiber membranes were more hydrophobic than those membranes made from pure PVDF, the former also exhibited pronounced ductile behavior when compared with the latter.

  abstract = {The axial development of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum) scaling on selected reverse osmosis (RO) membrane surfaces was investigated experimentally in a plate-and-frame RO system. Scaling experiments with model solutions demonstrated progressive axial development of surface gypsum crystals along the membrane surface. The impact of surface crystallization was characterized via flux decline measurements and by both optical and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) surface imaging. Surface coverage by gypsum scale (percent area covered and gypsum surface mass density) increased along the membranes (towards the membrane exit), consistent with the increase in concentration polarization. At the membrane channel entry, surface gypsum crystals were at their initial growth stage formed as primarily needle-like structures. With increasing axial distance from the entry, surface crystallization resulted in crystal structures that transitioned from the needle and plate-like structures, in the submicron size range, to partial rosettes to complete rosette structures in the mm size range. Significant differences were observed in the extent of surface scale coverage and surface crystal size among the membrane studied. Antiscalant addition to the feed solution led to progressive decline in the percent of area covered by scale with increasing antiscalant dosage and corresponding decrease in flux decline. Antiscalant addition resulted in perturbed surface crystal morphology of flattened and/or fused rosette crystal arms and to complete elimination of surface crystals at a sufficiently high antiscalant dosage. The present study demonstrates that gypsum scale development is affected by the formation of surface crystals on the membrane surface, thereby suggesting that there is merit to expanded research on the direct impact of surface topology and chemistry on surface crystallization of mineral salts.},

  abstract = {The Debye-H{\"u}ckel theory has been extended to allow for arbitrary concentration dependence of the electrolyte solution static permittivity. The theory follows the lines advanced by Erich H{\"u}ckel (H{\"u}ckel, E. Phys. Z. 1925, 26, 93) but gives rise to more general and lucid results. New theoretical expressions have been obtained for the excess free energy of solution, activity coefficient of water and mean ionic activity coefficient. The thermodynamic functions contain two terms representing interionic interactions and ion-water (solvation) interactions. The theory has been applied to calculate the activity coefficients of components in the aqueous solutions of alkali metal chlorides from LiCl to CsCl at ambient conditions making use of permittivities taken from experimental dielectric relaxation studies. Calculations without parameter adjustment have demonstrated a semiquantitative agreement with experimental data, reproducing both the nonmonotonic concentration dependence of the activity coefficients and the ordering of activity coefficients for the salts with different cations. A good agreement with experimental data is obtained for the aqueous solutions of LiCl in the concentration range up to 10 mol/kg. The nonmonotonic concentration dependence of activity coefficients is explained as a result of a balance between the effect of interionic interactions and the solvation contribution which appears quite naturally in the framework of the Debye-H{\"u}ckel approach after incorporation of variable permittivity of solution.},

Here, we report the synthesis of a crystalline TFPDHF 2D COF membrane constructed from two precursors of 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (TFP) and 9,9-dihexylfluorene-2,7diamine (DHF) through the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) method, for the first timed. A single COF layer is precisely four unit cells thick and can be transferred to different support surfaces layer by layer. The TFP-DHF 2D COF membrane supported on an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) porous support displayed remarkable permeabilities for both polar and nonpolar organic solvents, which were approximately 100 times higher than that of the amorphous membranes prepared by the same procedure and similar to that for the best of the reported polymer membranes. The transport mechanism through the TFP-DHF 2D COF membrane was found to be a viscous flow coupled with a strong slip boundary enhancement, which was also different from those of the amorphous polymer membranes. The membrane exhibited a steep molecular sieving with a molecular weight retention onset (MWRO) of approximately 600 Da and a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of approximately 900 Da. The substantial performance enhancement was attributed to the structural change from an amorphous structure to a well-defined ordered porous structure, which clearly demonstrated the high potential for the application of 2D COFs as the next generation of membrane materials.},

  abstract = {Ammonia is a critical chemical to manufacture the products we use every day and also a potential hydrogen carrier for hydrogen delivery and off-board storage in the hydrogen economy. Industrial production of ammonia, mainly through the modified Haber- Bosch cycles with Fe-based catalysts, is an energy- and carbon-intensive process. This makes searching for high-performance thermal redox pairs in a chemical looping process that can be powered by renewable energy for ammonia synthesis fundamentally important. It is believed that changing the bonding states of thermodynamically stable perovskite oxides with metal alloying is a promising approach to find an exceptional thermal redox material. Here, we strategically combine random sampling, high-throughput density functional theory modeling, and machine-learned free-energy descriptors to systematically investigate temperature- and compositional-dependent thermodynamics of metal-alloyed perovskite redox pairs for thermal ammonia synthesis from a large chemical space. We discover that an A-site-alloyed perovskite is mostly activated via ``cooperative enhancement'', paving the path for future `physics-inspired' designs of novel redox materials with complex compositions.},

Desalination of oilfield-produced water at the San Ardo water reclamation facility, CA, SPE 121520-PP, 2009) activities is available at temperatures between 160 and 200 {$^\circ$}F (71--93 {$^\circ$}C). Desalination of this deoiled produced water is accomplished currently by reverse osmosis after a number of steps including cooling. Membrane distillation processes can utilize this sensible heat to achieve desalination. Direct-contact membrane distillation studies using a hollow-fiber membrane module with brine in the cross-flow have been successfully conducted using a variety of produced waters such as Chevron A [Pre-RO, Post WEMCO; the latter refers to an induced gas/dissolved gas flotation (IGF/DGF) technique], Chevron B1, and Chevron B2 having total dissolved solids (TDS) respectively of 7622, 12040, and 35000 mg/L. The brine feed temperature was varied between 50 and 85 {$^\circ$}C. The effect of brine feed flow rate variation was also studied. At 80 {$^\circ$}C, the highest observed water vapor flux at a higher feed brine velocity was 15 kg/m2{$\cdot$}h. The permeated waters were substantially pure with a very low TDS value in each case, indicating very high salt rejections. These conclusions held even when the feed deoiled produced water was concentrated via batch recirculation to recover as much as 80\% of the feed produced water in the distillate stream.},

Training algorithm for neurons and hidden layers for different feedforward backpropagation networks at the uniform threshold function TANSIG-PURELIN are used and run for 1000 epochs. The complex structure encountered in moist porous materials, along with the differences in thermal conductivity of the constituents makes it difficult to predict the effective thermal conductivity accurately. For this reason, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been utilized in this field.

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is a thermally driven separation process. There are four types of MD: direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD), vacuum membrane distillation (VMD), air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) and sweep gas membrane distillation (SGMD). MD process has a number of potential advantages, namely, low operating temperature and hydraulic pressure, very high rejection of nonvolatile solutes, smaller footprint and potentially high water vapor flux for example in DCMD compared to conventional thermal distillation processes. For such reasons, MD has been considered as an emerging new technology in desalination and wastewater treatment. This chapter addresses a variety of applications of MD employing primarily the techniques of DCMD, VMD, and AGMD. State-of-the-art research results in different areas such as, desalination of seawater and brackish water, produced water treatment from oil exploration and coal seam gas production, high temperature DCMD, water treatment in bioreactors and oily wastewaters, treatment of processing streams from dairy, food, beverage industries and animal husbandry, concentration of acids, membrane distillation in biorefineries, mineral recovery and radioactive water treatment, are briefly presented and discussed in this chapter.},

  abstract = {Understanding and controlling nucleation is important for many crystallization applications. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is often used as a model system to investigate nucleation mechanisms. Despite its great importance in geology, biology, and many industrial applications, CaCO3 nucleation is still a topic of intense discussion, with new pathways for its growth from ions in solution proposed in recent years. These new pathways include the so-called nonclassical nucleation mechanism via the assembly of thermodynamically stable prenucleation clusters, as well as the formation of a dense liquid precursor phase via liquid-liquid phase separation. Here, we present results from a combined experimental and computational investigation on the precipitation of CaCO3 in dilute aqueous solutions. We propose that a dense liquid phase ( containing 4-7 H2O per CaCO3 unit) forms in supersaturated solutions through the association of ions and ion pairs without significant participation of larger ion clusters. This liquid acts as the precursor for the formation of solid CaCO3 in the form of vaterite, which grows via a net transfer of ions from solution according to z Ca2+ + z CO32- -{$>$} z CaCO3. The results show that all steps in this process can be explained according to classical concepts of crystal nucleation and growth, and that long-standing physical concepts of nucleation can describe multistep, multiphase growth mechanisms.},

The hot brine was either city water, city water containing salt at the level of 3.5, 6 or 10\%, or sea water trucked in from Long Island Sound, CT. One to ten horizontal crossflow hollow fiber membrane modules each having either 2448 or 2652 hollow fibers and 0.61 or 0.66m2 surface area were combined in various configurations to study the plant performance. The highest water vapor flux of 55kg/(m2h) was achieved with two modules in series; the flux varied between 15 and 33kg/(m2h) for configurations employing 6--10 modules. The highest distillate production rate achieved was 0.62gallons per minute (gpm). The membrane modules never showed any sign of distillate contamination by salt. The plant operated successfully with a very limited flux reduction at salt concentrations up to 19.5\% from sea water. A mathematical model was successfully developed to describe the performance of the pilot plant with multiple crossflow modules in different test configurations.},

This study investigates the thermal transport properties of composite sulfur cathode materials and phase change materials based on graphene aerogels using molecular dynamics simulation. A graphene aerogel model is established, and the effects of sulfur and octadecane content on the thermal transport properties of graphene aerogels and graphene aerogel-based composites are examined. A theoretical model of heat transport is developed to analyze the contribution of fillers and graphene aerogels to the thermal conductivity of the composites.

  abstract = {In this study, the dynamics of scaled-up membrane distillation (MD) modules are tackled for the treatment of highly saline desalination brines. Physical phenomena occurring inside the feed chamber during process scale-up including temperature evolution, species distribution and scaling likeliness were explored using a multicomponent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that couples momentum, heat, ions transport and water permeation across the membrane. The model was calibrated with experiments carried out on a lab-scale direct contact MD system fed with concentrated seawater with a salinity of 61 g/L. The complete fall-off of the permeate flux occurred when the salinity reached 170 g/L from 61 g/L, caused by a scaling mostly due to calcium sulfate (gypsum). In order to predict scaling occurrence, an in-house code is embedded in the CFD model to solve Pitzer's equation at every cell of the domain, enabling the calculation of species activity coefficients, the feed ionic strength, species effective concentration and degree of saturation of the solution with respect to gypsum. Results unveil that during the MD process of brines, the degree of saturation increases considerably in membrane vicinity while the average outlet salinity remains close to that at the inlet due to the relatively high flow rate. Extrapolation to longer modules revealed that an increase in the feed temperature increases the scaling likeliness while flow rates, especially in the high range, did not significantly impact scaling formation. The drop in performance from lab-scale module to a scaled-up size is shown for 1 m long generic modules with and without the use of antiscalants.},

  abstract = {Magmatic textures provide an insufficiently explored tool to interpret physical processes and environmental variables that drive differentiation and crystallization in magma chambers. We derive a new method, which utilizes the crystal size distribution (CSD), to retrieve the rates of nucleation and growth from natural igneous rocks. However, a single CSD results from an arbitrary number of combinations of nucleation and growth rates; if additional parameters such as crystallinity evolution are employed, the solution for rates becomes unique. Interpretation of representative log--linear CSD trends shows that the nucleation rates are sensitive to even minor features of the CSD, whereas the growth rate functions are mainly related to the crystallinity evolution. The reconstructed growth rates become minimal at intermediate crystallinities but diverge to very high values at the beginning and the end of crystallization. This general result is related to the small effective area of the solid--liquid interface close to the liquidus (few small grains) and near the solidus (largely solidified with diminishing melt pools). Assuming that growth rate is related to environmental variables such as magma undercooling, these results suggest that the solid fraction in many magmas increases in a sigmoidal manner over their crystallization interval and indicate the tendency for largest undercooling at the beginning and at the end of crystallization. For crystallization times constrained by conductive cooling models, the growth rates calculated for representative CSDs are of the order of 10-11 cm s-1, which is in a good agreement with in situ observations of Hawaiian lava lakes. Calculated growth rates are inversely proportional to the magma body size and increase from the chamber interior to the margins.},

  abstract = {Secondary nucleation is the key mechanism behind the creation of new crystals in industrial crystallization processes. Sodium chlorate has widely been used throughout literature as a model compound to study secondary nucleation due to its ability to crystallize as a chiral solid which makes it feasible to determine whether new crystals have originated from solution or from a seed crystal. Despite its widespread use, a significant level of ambiguity regarding sodium chlorate still exists including inconsistent solubility data, nontransferrable results between batch and continuous experiments and inconclusive theories about whether secondary nucleation of sodium chlorate is possible through fluid shear. In the present work, the inconsistencies around sodium chlorate are resolved using novel continuous shear-induced secondary nucleation experiments involving stationary seed crystals. First, accurate solubility data of sodium chlorate in water was determined using a laser method and compared with literature data. Second, the metastable zone width was determined to be surprisingly narrow and continuous shear-induced secondary nucleation experiments of sodium chlorate using stationary seed crystals were therefore unsuccessful as heterogeneous nucleation was favored over secondary nucleation. This explains why previous continuous secondary nucleation experiments failed. Finally, it was found that mechanical impact readily created fines on the seed crystal surface and that the resulting fines acted as new particles through initial breeding. Based on microscopic analysis it was observed that a washing step was sufficient to remove fines from the seed crystal surface. Intriguingly, the resulting seed crystals without fines failed to induce secondary nucleation. Therefore, fluid shear was insufficient to disperse secondary nuclei of sodium chlorate. Overall, the results presented herein reveal a better understanding of secondary nucleation as the impact of initial breeding is reported in detail for the first time. Initial breeding significantly contributes to secondary nucleation and controlling initial breeding is therefore essential to govern crystallization processes.},

A derivation of an equation for the crystallization pressure based on the chemical potentials of the loaded and the unloaded faces of a growing crystal is provided. The equation obtained is compared to other equations available in the literature and the different approaches are discussed in detail. The treatment also includes the non-ideal behavior of the liquid phase using the ion interaction approach (Pitzer equations) which is well-established in solution thermodynamics. Incorporating the ion interaction equations in the crystallization pressure equation yields a quite simple expression that appears to be more convenient than previous treatments. The equation is applied to calculate crystallization pressures for supersaturated solutions of aqueous NaCl, NaNO3, Na2SO4, and MgSO4 including the various hydrated forms of these salts. Depending on the nature of the salt, neglecting the non-ideal behavior may cause considerable error in crystallization pressure calculations. Finally, it is emphasized that the basic assumption of non-uniform pressure is fundamental to understand the dynamics of crystallization pressure evolving in porous materials. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Desalination is often considered an approach for mitigating water stress. Despite the abundance of saline water worldwide, additional energy consumption and increased costs present barriers to widespread deployment of desalination as a municipal water supply. Specific energy consumption (SEC) is a common measure of the energy use in desalination processes, and depends on many operational and water quality factors. We completed multiple linear regression and relative importance statistical analyses of factors affecting SEC using both small-scale meta-data and municipal-scale empirical data to predict the energy consumption of desalination. Statistically significant results show water quality and initial year of operations to be significant and important factors in estimating SEC, explaining over 80\% of the variation in SEC. More recent initial year of operations, lower salinity raw water, and higher salinity product water accurately predict lower values of SEC. Economic analysis revealed a weak statistical relationship between SEC and cost of water production. Analysis of associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions revealed important considerations of both electricity source and SEC in estimating the GHG-related sustainability of desalination. Results of our statistical analyses can aid decision-makers by predicting the SEC of desalination to a reasonable degree of accuracy with limited data.},

  abstract = {In view of the scaling problem in the membrane water treatment process, the adhesion mechanism of gypsum crystals on different commercial microfiltration membranes in aqueous solution was firstly investigated using experimental methods and molecular dynamics simulations. The membrane chemistry has the most significant impact on its adhesion potential to gypsum crystals. Hydrophilic membranes have higher potential to scaling by the gypsum crystals compared to the hydrophobic membranes. The number of polar groups in the membrane molecules has higher effect on the adhesion energy than the variety of polar groups. The anti-adhering properties of the membranes increase with decreasing absolute adhesion energy. Physical structure of membranes was also crucial to its adhesion behavior under the condition that the adhesion energy of membranes was close to each other. The larger pore that exceeds a proper range leads to less adhesion mass. Subsequently, the membranes potentially used for membrane distillation were successfully predicted from the aspect of membrane chemistry in terms of their anti-scaling propensity using molecular dynamics simulations. This article provides an insight for the mechanism of gypsum scaling, and gives the prediction on the anti-scaling performance of the potential polymer membranes in membrane distillation.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) has shown potential as a means of desalination and water purification. As a thermally driven membrane technology which runs at relatively low pressure, which can withstand high salinity feed streams, and which is potentially more resistant to fouling, MD could be used for desalination where reverse osmosis is not a good option. The use of thermal energy, rather than electrical energy, and the fact that MD membranes can withstand dryout make this technology attractive for renewable power applications as well. However, most research on MD has focused on maximizing membrane flux as opposed to minimizing energy consumption and cost, and current MD systems suffer from poor energy efficiency compared to other desalination systems. In solar driven systems, the reported thermal performance has not been much better than a simple solar still. This paper examines the energy efficiency of single-stage MDbased desalination cycles in each of the MD configurations commonly used for desalination (direct contact, air gap, and vacuum) and compares the gained output ratio, or GOR, of each configuration across the range of membrane module geometries, and operating conditions. Limitations of each configuration are identified. Direct contact MD and air gap MD, in particular, have potential for high GOR.},

  abstract = {An evaluation of shale pore connectivity is essential for predicting the production behavior and optimizing the development plan of shale gas. To systematically investigate the multiscale connectivity characteristics and controlling factors, complementary tests were conducted on four overmature marine shale samples from southern China (one each from Longmaxi Formation and Wufeng Formation, and two from Niutitang Formation) with different maturity and composition. The methods included mercury intrusion capillary pressure (MICP), spontaneous imbibition with deionized water and n-decane, saturated diffusion distribution with seven nanosized tracers, N-2 physisorpdon, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography. Moreover, a novel repeated MICP measurement technique was developed and used to evaluate the pore connectivity from the distribution behavior of residual mercury. Results indicate that the connectivity loss of hydrophilic pore networks owing to an increased maturity and the compaction causes pore shrinkage and bond breakage between pore networks. According to the three-dimensional reconstruction and pore network extraction of FIB-SEM images, pores in organic matter (OM) have a good pore connectivity, but the minerals surrounding the OM reduce the overall pore connectivity of the shale matrix. By evaluating the pore connectivity using different methods, the hydrocarbon migration pattern in overmature marine shales was established. Our results imply that in addition to creating induced fracture networks, effectively connecting induced fractures with preexisting microcracks or joint sets between OM pore networks and transport pores can also be used to enhance overall pore connectivity. Microwave heating in shale reservoirs may be an effective way of further improving the production and recovery of hydrocarbons.},

  abstract = {Despite increasing sustainable water purification, current desalination membranes still suffer from insufficient permeability and treatment efficiency, greatly hindering extensive practical applications. In this work, we provide a new membrane design protocol and molecule-level mechanistic understanding of vapor transport for the treatment of hypersaline waters via a membrane distillation process by rationally fabricating more robust metal-based carbon nanotube (CNT) network membranes, featuring a superhydrophobic superporous surface (80.0 {\textpm} 2.3\% surface porosity). With highly permeable ductile metal hollow fibers as substrates, the construction of a superhydrophobic (water contact angle {$\sim$}170{$^\circ$}) CNT network layer endows the membranes with not only almost perfect salt rejection (over 99.9\%) but a promising water flux (43.6 L{$\cdot$}m--2{$\cdot$}h--1), which outperforms most existing inorganic distillation membranes. Both experimental and molecular dynamics simulation results indicate that such an enhanced water flux can be ascribed to an ultra-low liquid--solid contact interface ({$\sim$}3.23\%), allowing water vapor to rapidly transport across the membrane structure via a combined mechanism of Knudsen diffusion (more dominant) and viscous flow while efficiently repelling high-salinity feed via forming a Cassie--Baxter state. A more hydrophobic surface is more in favor of not only water desorption from the CNT outer surface but superfast and frictionless water vapor transport. By constructing a new superhydrophobic triple-phase interface, the conceptional design strategy proposed in this work can be expected to be extended to other membrane material systems as well as more water treatment applications.},

By combining coarse-grained molecular dynamics and newly developed accurate models of GO, the driving forces that lead to the various morphologies are resolved. Two hydrophilic polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), are used to illustrate the thermodynamically stable morphologies of GO and relevant dispersion mechanisms. GO self-assembly can be controlled by changing the degree of oxidation, varying from fully aggregated over graphitic domains to intercalated assemblies with polymer bilayers between sheets. The long-term stability of a dispersion is extremely important for many commercial applications of GO composites. For any degree of oxidation, GO does not disperse in PVA as a thermodynamic equilibrium product, whereas in PEG dispersions are only thermodynamically stable for highly oxidized GO. These findings---validated against the extensive literature on GO systems in organic solvents---furnish quantitative explanations for the empirically unpredictable aggregation characteristics of GO and provide computational methods to design directed synthesis routes for diverse self-assemblies and applications.},

CGMD has a conductive spacer in the gap between the membrane and condensing surface rather than more commonly used insulating materials. Flux measurements with two experimental systems are used to validate the numerical models for PGMD and CGMD. PGMD has 20\% higher GOR (energy efficiency) than an air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) system of the same size, whereas CGMD can have two times higher GOR than even PGMD. Increasing gap effective thermal conductivity in CGMD has negligible benefits beyond kgap {$\approx$} 10 W/m K under the conditions of this study. The direction of pure water flow in the gap has a significant influence on overall system energy efficiency, especially in the case of CGMD. Using a countercurrent configuration for the pure water flow in the gap relative to the cold stream leads to 40\% higher GOR than flow cocurrent with the cold water stream.},

Knudsen's theory can be straightforwardly applied to filter membranes with arrays of extended holes for example, however, for the inverse geometry arrangement, which arises when solid nanowires or fibers are arranged into porous interwoven material (like in carpets or brushes) the derivation of an analytical theory framework was still missing. In this paper, we have identified the specific geometric and thermodynamic parameters that determine the gas diffusion kinetics in arrays of randomly oriented cylinders and provide a set of analytical expressions allowing to comprehensively describe the gas transport in such structures. We confirmed analytical solutions by Monte Carlo simulations. We specify our findings for an atomic layer deposition process, the diffusion of trimethyaluminium molecules into a carbon nanotube array, but highlight the applicability of our derivation for other fields comprising gas diffusion membranes, composite materials, fuel cells and more.},

One efficient way of analyzing big data, recognizing complex patterns, and extracting trends is through machine-learning (ML) algorithms. The field of porous media, and more generally geoscience, have also witnessed much progress, and recent progress in developing various ML techniques have benefitted various problems in porous media and geoscience across disparate scales. Thus, it is becoming increasingly clear that it is imperative to adopt advanced ML methods for the problems in porous media and geoscience because they enable researchers to solve many difficult problems. At the same time, one can use the already existing extensive knowledge of porous media to endow ML algorithms and develop novel physics-guided methods. The goal of this review paper is to provide the first comprehensive review of the recently developed methods in the ML algorithms and describe their application to porous media and geoscience. Thus, we review the basic concept of the ML and describe more advanced methods, known as deep-learning algorithms. Then, the application of such methods to various problems in porous media and geoscience, such as hydrological modeling, fluid flow in porous media, and (sub)surface characterization, are reviewed.

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is a promising green technology that can utilize waste heat to concentrate non-volatile solutes, or remove volatiles and dissolved gases from an aqueous feed. The primary reason for the limited commercial implementation of MD is membrane pore-wetting, which deteriorates the separation performance. For oily wastewater, the surfactants are particularly detrimental due to the inherent nature to lower surface tension, which reduces the liquid entry pressure (LEP) and thereby increases the likelihood for pore-wetting. Unfortunately, the understanding on the influence of surfactants on MD performance is limited. To contribute to the knowledge base, we systematically investigated five surfactants with different hydrophobicities and charge types, in the absence and presence of salt, both via experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that surfactants adversely affect MD performance, and different surfactants exert different influences. Among the anionic surfactants of different hydrophobicities, the most hydrophobic exhibited the worst MD performance, which is tied to greatest surfactant-membrane attraction. However, when comparing surfactants of different charge types, the greatest surfactant-membrane attraction is not linked to the worst MD performance, suggesting factors like water-membrane affinity that underlies wetting propensity have to be considered too. This study provides more mechanistic insights into the role of surfactants in affecting MD performance.},

Three module orientations and four feed channel geometries were investigated via experiments and simulations for oily feeds. Two key highlights emanated from this study. Firstly, module orientation mattered for DCMD, particularly in view of the formation of natural thermal convective currents and when the particle density of the particulate foulants varied. Particulate foulants with density much lesser and greater than water only deposited when the membrane was oriented respectively atop and beneath the feed. Secondly, the lack of consideration of convection currents, oil coalescence and the corresponding cake-enhanced temperature polarization in the simulations caused disagreement with the experimental results, which underscores the importance of these factors. This highlights that the optimization of MD modules particularly for treating oily feeds requires more mechanistic studies, especially in view of the thermal gradients, rather than relying on analogy with pressure-driven filtration processes.},

However, the comparatively large pore size and low liquid entry pressure (LEP) of nanofibrous membranes often result in severe membrane scaling and wetting. In this work, superhydrophobic nanofibrous membranes with tailored membrane pore size and interface were successfully fabricated via sequential electrospinning and electrospraying approaches. Results revealed that the decreased membrane pore size and increased interface evaporation area could synchronously mitigate membrane scaling and improve water flux. Besides, the water recovery of the membrane could be further increased with the aid of antiscalant, e.g., polymer polyacrylic acid, toward treating a nearly saturated gypsum solution. The excellent concentration performance was attributed to the cooperation of the antiscalant that in\- hibits the nuclei formation and the engineered surface that reduced the adhesion between the membrane interface and gypsum crystals. Notably, the resultant membrane also showed a high initial flux of {\textasciitilde}40 L m- 2 h- 1 and high salts rejection efficiency of {\textasciitilde}100\% in a continuous concentration process for over 100 h.

Porous polypropylene membranes were coated with a carbon nanotube (CNT)/poly(vinyl alcohol) layer, resulting in composite membranes having a binary structure that combines the hydrophobic properties critical for MD with the hydrophilic and conductive properties of the CNTs. We demonstrate that the addition of the CNT layer increases membrane flux due to enhanced heat transport from the bulk feed to the membrane surface, a result of CNT's high thermal transport properties. Furthermore, we show how hydroxide ion generation, driven by water electrolysis on the electrically conducting membrane surface, can be used to efficiently dissolve silicate scaling that developed during the process of desalinating the geothermal brine, negating the need for chemical cleaning.},

In response to this need, we developed a new CA model (GSA-CA) using the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) to capture and project urban growth patterns in arid regions. We calibrated the GSA-CA model for the arid city of Urumqi in Northwest China from 2000 to 2010, and validated the model from 2010 to 2020, and then applied to project urban growth in 2040. The results indicated that the optimal performance of the model was achieved when the fraction of the population was 0.5. GSA-CA achieved an overall accuracy of 98.42\% and a figure of merit (FOM) of 43.03\% for the year 2010, and an overall accuracy of 98.52\% with FOM of 37.64\% for 2020.

Here, we propose a hierarchical nanotexturing of piezoelectric films as active microfluidic actuators, exploiting a unique combination of both topographical and chemical properties on flexible surfaces, while also introducing design concepts of shear hydrophobicity and tensile hydrophilicity. In doing so, we create nanostructured surfaces that are, at the same time, both slippery (low in-plane pinning) and sticky (high normal-to-plane liquid adhesion). By enabling fluid transportation on such arbitrarily shaped surfaces, we demonstrate efficient fluid motions on inclined, vertical, inverted, or even flexible geometries in three dimensions. Such surfaces can also be deformed and then reformed into their original shapes, thereby paving the way for advanced microfluidic applications.},

  abstract = {We present a physics-informed deep neural network (DNN) method for estimating hydraulic conductivity in saturated and unsaturated flows governed by Darcy's law. For saturated flow, we approximate hydraulic conductivity and head with two DNNs and use Darcy's law in addition to measurements of hydraulic conductivity and head to train these DNNs. For unsaturated flow, we approximate unsaturated conductivity function and capillary pressure with DNNs and train these DNNs using measurements of capillary pressure and the Richards equation. Because it is difficult to measure unsaturated conductivity in the field, we assume that no measurements of unsaturated conductivity are available. The proposed approach enforces the partial differential equation (PDE) (Darcy or Richards equation) constraints by minimizing the PDE residual at select points in the simulation domain. We demonstrate that physics constraints increase the accuracy of DNN approximations of sparsely observed functions and allow for training DNNs when no direct measurements of the functions of interest are available. For the saturated conductivity estimation problem, we show that the physics-informed DNN method is more accurate than the state-of-the-art maximum a posteriori probability method. For the unsaturated flow in homogeneous porous media, we find that the proposed method can accurately estimate the pressure-conductivity relationship based on the capillary pressure measurements only, even in the presence of measurement noise.},

  abstract = {Accurate estimation of permeability is critical for oil and gas reservoir development and management, as it controls production rate. After assessing numerical techniques ranging from pore network modeling (PNM) to the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), an AI-based workflow is developed for a quick and accurate estimation of the permeability of a complex carbonate rock from its X-ray micro computed tomography (micro-CT) image. Following features engineering using both image processing and PNM, we trained and tested the workflow on thousands of segmented 3D micro-CT images using both shallow and deep learning algorithms to assess the permeability. A broad variety of supervised learning algorithms are implemented and tested, including linear regression, support vector regression, improved gradient boosting, and convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we explored a hybrid physics-driven neural network that takes into account both the X-ray micro-CT images and petrophysical properties. Finally, we found that the predicted permeability of a complex carbonate by machine learning (ML) agrees very well with that of a more computationally-intensive voxelbased direct simulation. In addition, the ML model developed here provides a substantial reduction in computation time by roughly three orders of magnitude compared to that of the LBM. This paper highlights the crucial role played by features engineering in predicting petrophysical properties by machine and deep learning. The proposed framework, integrating diverse learning algorithms, rock imaging, and modeling, has the potential to quickly and accurately estimate petrophysical properties to aid in reservoir simulation and characterization.

The debris present, roughly one-third by mass, can be removed by a base wash. A number of techniques, including solid state NMR, demonstrate that the properties of the base-washed material are independent of the base used and that it contains similar functional groups to those present in the debris but at a lower concentration. Removal of the oxidation debris cleans the GO, revealing its true monolayer nature and in the process increases the C/O ratio (i.e., a deoxygenation). By contrast, treating GO with hydrazine both removes the debris and reduces (both deoxygenations) the graphene sheets.},

  abstract = {Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single CPU core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to LAMMPS and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in LAMMPS are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.

Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The LAMMPS code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel FFTs for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the St{\o}rmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, LAMMPS supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features.

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is an emerging thermally-driven technology that poses a lot of promise in desalination, and water and wastewater treatment. Developments in membrane design and the use of alternative energy sources have provided much improvement in the viability of MD for different applications. However, fouling of membranes is still one of the major issues that hounds the long-term stability performance of MD. Membrane fouling is the accumulation of unwanted materials on the surface or inside the pores of a membrane that results to a detrimental effect on the overall performance of MD. If not addressed appropriately, it could lead to membrane damage, early membrane replacement or even shutdown of operation. Similar with other membrane separation processes, fouling of MD is still an unresolved problem. Due to differences in membrane structure and design, and operational conditions, the fouling formation mechanism in MD may be different from those of pressure-driven membrane processes. In order to properly address the problem of fouling, there is a need to understand the fouling formation and mechanism happening specifically for MD. This review details the different foulants and fouling mechanisms in the MD process, their possible mitigation and control techniques, and characterization strategies that can be of help in understanding and minimizing the fouling problem.},

  abstract = {We present a simple and rapid methodology to characterize the water and solute permeability coefficients (A and B, respectively) and structural parameter (S) of forward osmosis (FO) membranes. The methodology comprises a single FO experiment divided into four stages, each using a different concentration of draw solution. The experimental water and reverse salt fluxes measured in each stage are fitted to the corresponding FO transport equations by performing a least-squares non-linear regression, using A, B, and S as regression parameters. Hand-cast thin-film composite (TFC) FO membranes and commercial TFC FO, TFC reverse osmosis (RO), and cellulose acetate-based asymmetric FO membranes are evaluated following this protocol. We compare the membrane properties obtained with our FO-based methodology with those derived from existing protocols based on an RO experiment followed by an FO experiment. For all membranes, the FO-based protocol gives more accurate predictions of the water and salt fluxes than the existing method. The numerical robustness of the method and the sensitivity of the regression parameters to random errors in the measured quantities are thoroughly analyzed. The assessment shows that confidence in the accuracy of the determined membrane parameters can be enhanced by simultaneously achieving close fitting of the predicted fluxes to experimental measurements (i.e., high R2 values) and constant water to salt flux ratios in each stage. Additionally, the existing and proposed approaches yield consistently dissimilar results for some of the analyzed membranes, indicating a discrepancy that might be attributed to the different driving forces utilized in RO and in FO that should be further investigated.},

In particular, the application of omniphobicity to containers of prepackaged foods such as curry is extremely important for reducing food waste because they are especially liable to remain in the container owing to their high viscosity. To realize such application, the surface must be biocompatible to prevent health damage to the human body. However, few omniphobic surfaces with biocompatibility have been developed. Here, we present a silicone oil-immobilized biocompatible slippery surface with omniphobicity. A biocompatible base layer to immobilize the silicone oil as a lubricant was fabricated by combining a boehmite nanostructure and silicone oil grafting through thermal treatment. The slippery surface demonstrated omniphobicity not only for room temperature liquids but also for high-temperature liquids including hot liquid foods. In addition, the surface exhibited long-term stability against boiling in hot water. Moreover, the surface could be fabricated within an hour. We believe that because of its excellent biocompatibility and omniphobicity, this surface will be applied to not only food containers but also various other applications.},

Scaling prediction conducted using geochemical modelling showed that at a temperature of 30{$^\circ$}C and for neutral-pH water from the geothermal intake (GT-1 well) there were good conditions for the precipitation of aragonite, barite, calcite, chalcedony, dolomite, hydroxyapatite and quartz on the reverse osmosis membranes. A theoretically selected phosphonate scaling inhibitor failed to protect the membranes against sediment precipitation. Adjusting the pH of the water to ca. 5 by treating it with hydrochloric acid had a positive effect on the desalination process. On the basis of a morphological evaluation of sediments in the electron scanning microscope image and through the analysis of the chemical composition of the sediments crystallised on the membrane, silicates (SiO2) and aluminosilicates (Al2SiO5) as well as barite (BaSO4) and copper sulphate (CuSO4) crystalline structures were found. Calcium phosphate as well as celestite (SrSO4) and strontianite (SrCO3) sediments were also observed, which points to significant concentration polarisation. Most grains were a few to a maximum of 30{$\mu$}m in size. Sediment clusters were usually heterogeneous in character. Desalination was performed with a high permeate recovery ratio (75--78\%) with favourable key indicator retention ratios.},

During the entire treatment period, the pH remained almost constant (4.06-4.24). Conductance varied with KCl concentration, but except for minor fluctuations appeared to be unaffected by any form of treatment. While aggregation of hematite was observed during dynamic magnetic treatment (change in turbidity, scattered light intensity, and photon correlation spectroscopy), little effect on aggregation state was observed for the static systems or for the flowing systems in the absence of the field. Mobility also increased during the first 30 min of static and dynamic magnetic treatment. After longer treatment periods (90-120 min), the mobility decreased, but in almost all cases remained larger than in the case of untreated systems. Changes in both mobility and particle aggregation state also showed a significant dependence on electrolyte concentration. These effects are discussed in terms of a magnetohydrodynamic interaction between the magnetic field and the charged colloidal particles, which results only when the particles are made to pass rapidly through the field.},

  abstract = {Mineral scaling is one of the primary factors that constrain the performance of membrane desalination. However, compared to numerous studies on organic and biological fouling, less effort has been invested in understanding the mechanisms of mineral scaling. Although anti-fouling membranes have been successfully fabricated to mitigate organic and biological fouling, little progress has been made on the design and fabrication of scalingresistant membranes. In this review, we discuss the occurrence and consequences of mineral scaling in different membrane desalination processes, and emphasize the complex nature of membrane scaling regulated by feedwater chemistry. We describe established theories associated with mineral scaling, and highlight the knowledge and technology advances in the field of biomineralization that demonstrates the important role of surface chemistry in controlling mineral formation. Current strategies of scaling mitigation are predominantly independent of membrane materials, while the feasibility of developing scaling-resistant membranes has been indicated but not fully achieved in the literature. Accordingly, potential design strategies and challenges associated with the development of novel membrane materials with improved scaling resistance are discussed, and future research needs are proposed.},

  abstract = {We investigated the relationship between membrane surface properties and silica scaling in reverse osmosis (RO). The effects of membrane hydrophilicity, free energy for heterogeneous nucleation, and surface charge on silica scaling were examined by comparing thin-film composite polyamide membranes grafted with a variety of polymers. Results show that the rate of silica scaling was independent of both membrane hydrophilicity and free energy for heterogeneous nucleation. In contrast, membrane surface charge demonstrated a strong correlation with the extent of silica scaling (R2 {$>$} 0.95, p {$<$} 0.001). Positively charged membranes significantly facilitated silica scaling, whereas a more negative membrane surface charge led to reduced scaling. This observation suggests that deposition of negatively charged silica species on the membrane surface plays a critical role in silica scale formation. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms governing silica scaling in reverse osmosis and highlight the potential of membrane surface modification as a strategy to reduce silica scaling.},

  abstract = {Resistance to fouling is often cited as an advantage of emerging desalination technologies such as forward osmosis and membrane distillation over the widely-used reverse osmosis process. However, the nature and magnitude of differences in fouling behavior between these three processes are not well characterized. This study directly compares the fouling and scaling behavior of reverse osmosis (RO), forward osmosis (FO), and direct contact membrane distillation (MD) in the same membrane module under identical hydrodynamic conditions (flux and cross-flow velocity). Fouling experiments were conducted using calcium sulfate as a model inorganic foulant and alginate as a model organic foulant. Although all three processes tolerated some degree of feed supersaturation for 36 h without inorganic fouling (scaling), FO exhibited the greatest scaling resistance, withstanding a feed of 33{\textpm} 2 mM CaSO4 (approximately twice saturation) without significant flux decline. Scaling occurred at similar concentrations at the membrane between MD and RO; however, while MD tolerated a more concentrated bulk feed due to reduced concentration polarization, flux decline after fouling was considerably more severe in MD. In contrast, MD tolerated organic fouling much better than FO or RO: despite accumulating a similar quantity of alginate gel over 18 h of operation, flux declined only 14\% in MD versus 46--47\% in RO and FO. These results are explained with respect to differences in temperature, membrane materials, and transport mechanisms between the three processes. Although FO and MD each exhibited superior resistance to one type of foulant, neither process outperformed RO in resistance to both organic and inorganic fouling. These findings inform a more nuanced approach to process selection for the treatment of complex water sources.},

  abstract = {1. When the motion of ions in a gas takes place in a magnetic field the rates of diffusion and the velocities due to an electric force may be determined by methods similar to those given in a previous paper. The effect of the magnetic field may be determined by considering the motion of each ion between collisions with molecules. The magnetic force causes the ions to be deflected in their free paths, and when no electric force is acting the paths are spirals, the axes being along the direction of the magnetic force. If H be the intensity of the magnetic field, e the charge, and m the mass of an ion, then the radius r of the spiral is mv/He, v being the velocity in the direction perpendicular to H. The distance that the ion travels in the interval between two collisions in a direction normal to the magnetic force is a chord of the circle of radius r. The average lengths of these chords may be reduced to any fraction of the projection of the mean free path in the direction of the magnetic force, so that the rate of diffusion of ions in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic force is less than the rate of diffusion in the direction of the force.},

We present an efficient implementation of a DPD model for graphical processing units (GPUs). As implemented in the LAMMPS molecular dynamics package, it can run effectively on current-generation supercomputers which often have hybrid nodes containing multi-core CPUs and (one or more) GPUs. Using efficient communication of information between the CPUs and GPUs, DPD interactions can be computed on the GPU while other portions of a full simulation model (boundary conditions, constraints, bonded interactions, diagnostic calculations, etc.) can be performed on the CPU. Our GPU-enhanced runs show a speedup of up to 9.5x versus many-core CPU simulations, and can run scalably across thousands of compute nodes. We briefly discuss how the new GPU implementation was validated against the CPU version for thermodynamics, diffusion, and hydrodynamic behavior. We also highlight large-scale models which the faster DPD implementation has enabled, for studies of monolayer self-assembly and thin-film instabilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Unlike pair-wise potentials, the Tersoff potential involves three-body terms, which require much more arithmetic operations and data dependency. In this contribution, we have implemented the GPU-accelerated version of several variants of the Tersoff potential for LAMMPS, an open-source massively parallel Molecular Dynamics code. Compared to the existing MPI implementation in LAMMPS, the GPU implementation exhibits a better scalability and offers a speedup of 2.2X when run on 1000 compute nodes on the Titan supercomputer. On a single node, the speedup ranges from 2.0 to 8.0 times, depending on the number of atoms per GPU and hardware configurations. The most notable features of our GPU-accelerated version include its design for MPI/accelerator heterogeneous parallelism, its compatibility with other functionalities in LAMMPS, its ability to give deterministic results and to support both NVIDIA CUDA- and OpenCL-enabled accelerators. Our implementation is now part of the GPU package in LAMMPS and accessible for public use. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Water was employed as the external coagulant, 70 wt.\% NMP in water was used as bore liquid. The rate of solvent-nonsolvent exchanged during membrane formation was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microscopy. The addition of DGDE in the dope solution decreases the exchange rate of solvent-nonsolvent during the membrane formation process, resulting in the suppression of the macrovoids formation. The tensile stress, elongation at break and Young's modulus of the PSf hollow fiber membranes increased with increasing the DGDE content. In addition, the effects of DGDE content, feed composition and feed solution temperature on the pervaporation performances were also investigated. The permeation rate and separation factor towards water for a 90 wt.\% aqueous ethanol solution through the asymmetric PSf hollow fiber membrane with a NMP/DGDE (8/2) ratio of co-solvent system were 172.7 g/m(2) h and 23.9, respectively.

However, superoleophobic surfaces-those that display contact angles greater than 150 degrees with organic liquids having appreciably lower surface tensions than that of water-are extremely rare. Calculations suggest that creating such a surface would require a surface energy lower than that of any known material. We show how a third factor, re-entrant surface curvature, in conjunction with chemical composition and roughened texture, can be used to design surfaces that display extreme resistance to wetting from a number of liquids with low surface tension, including alkanes such as decane and octane.},

Microscopic pockets of air trapped beneath the water droplets placed on these surfaces lead to a composite solid-liquid-air interface in thermodynamic equilibrium. Previous experimental and theoretical studies suggest that it may not be possible to form similar fully-equilibrated, composite interfaces with drops of liquids, such as alkanes or alcohols, that possess significantly lower surface tension than water (gamma/v = 72.1 mN/m). In this work we develop surfaces possessing re-entrant texture that can support strongly metastable composite solid-liquid-air interfaces, even with very low surface tension liquids such as pentane (gamma/v = 15.7 mN/m). Furthermore, we propose four design parameters that predict the measured contact angles for a liquid droplet on a textured surface, as well as the robustness of the composite interface, based on the properties of the solid surface and the contacting liquid. These design parameters allow us to produce two different families of re-entrant surfaces-randomly-deposited electrospun fiber mats and precisely fabricated microhoodoo surfaces-that can each support a robust composite interface with essentially any liquid. These omniphobic surfaces display contact angles greater than 150 degrees and low contact angle hysteresis with both polar and non-polar liquids possessing a wide range of surface tensions.},

  abstract = {Two prominent theories surround the origin of secondary nuclei in batch crystallization experiments. Traditionally, the generation of secondary nuclei has been attributed to attrition breeding, resulting from collisions between crystals, impeller, and vessel geometry. Mechanistically, it is assumed that the collision of crystals leads to the generation of fine particles and nucleation sites. More recently, an alternative mechanism has received considerable attention, namely, cluster breeding secondary nucleation whereby the source of fine particles is attributed to clusters in solution. In the present work, a detailed experimental investigation of particle wall collisions of active pharmaceutical ingredient crystals is conducted. A pressurized test rig was developed whereby crystals in suspension were fired through a nozzle perpendicular to a stainless steel target. Using shadowgraphy, direct imaging particle-plane collisions are captured for crystals between 100-400 {$\mu$}m as they approach a target surface with initial velocities of up to 10 m/s. Crystals approaching a target surface are seen to be cushioned by a squeeze film boundary layer, greatly reducing their impact velocities. Furthermore, below a critical freestream particle Reynolds number, complete particle arrest was observed, preventing contact with the target surface entirely. This work provides further evidence to suggest that indeed secondary nucleation cannot be accounted for through particle-impeller breakage events. The alternative crystal breeding ideology is therefore further supported.},

  abstract = {The development of accurate crystal breakage kinetics is paramount to extending the capability of optimization and modelling methods within the pharmaceutical drug-product sector. However, there exists little experimental data on the performance on typical breakage models when applied to small-scale pharmaceutical crystals. Therefore, experimental investigations of crystal impacts on a steel target were carried out across a range of crystal sizes and impact velocities in order to determine critical breakage parameters for a given model. Direct observation of each impact was captured via a high-speed Shadowgraphy imaging technique, capable of 1 {$\mu$}m crystal size resolution and up to a 125,000 frames-per-second capture rate. Crystals of Darunavir Ethanolate between a nominal 100 {$\rightarrow$} 500 {$\mu$}m size range were subject to impact velocities of 1 {$\rightarrow$} 10 m/s normal to the target surface. Furthermore, upon collision crystals were classified into one of three breakage modes: intact (Mode I), chipped (Mode II), or split/disintegrated (Mode III). The resulting data was then combined with a post-processing methodology utilizing a bi-variate histogram function and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). This in turn enabled the extraction of experimentally observed crystal failure velocities, breakage modes, and selection functions detailing how crystal breakage varies with both crystal size and impact velocity. This data was then used to evaluate the performance of current literature in describing crystal breakage within pharmaceutical applications. Furthermore, the methodology implemented in this work can be applied to a range of particulate systems, yielding a flexible tool for pharmaceutical modelling capabilities.},

Experiments, in the presence and absence of scale inhibitors, were carried out in a cross-flow membrane test cell in order to examine the extent of metastable region without scaling and the scale characteristics. Three types of flat sheet membranes (LPRO and NF) were used in the experiments. In the absence of inhibitors, scaling (as determined by observing scale crystals on the membrane surface in SEM micrographs) occurred at supersaturation ratio at the membrane surface higher than approximately 4 (or LSIm{$>$}1). These experiments show that partial coverage of the membrane by scale does not necessarily result in a proportional flux decline. Furthermore, it appears that the type of membrane affects the dominant CaCO3 polymorph formed on the membrane surface. Experiments with several commercial inhibitors were carried out, at a supersaturation ratio at the membrane surface of 9.8 (or LSIm{$\sim$}2), most of them with an inhibitor dose of 5mgL-1. All inhibitors (but one) performed well, i.e. no significant flux decline was observed during these tests. However, SEM observations on dried membrane samples revealed that, for three inhibitors, a thin layer of sludge-type deposits was formed, totally covering the membrane surface.},

  abstract = {Over the past few decades, advances in "aerogel science" have provoked an increasing interest for these materials in pharmaceutical sciences for drug delivery applications. Because of their high surface areas, high porosities and open pore structures which can be tuned and controlled by manipulation of synthesis conditions, nanostructured aerogels represent a promising class of materials for delivery of various drugs as well as enzymes and proteins. Along with biocompatible inorganic aerogels and biodegradable organic aerogels, more complex systems such as surface functionalized aerogels, composite aerogels and layered aerogels have also been under development and possess huge potential. Emphasis is given to the details of the aerogel synthesis and drug loading methods as well as the influence of synthesis parameters and loading methods on the adsorption and release of the drugs. Owing to their ability to increase the bioavailability of low solubility drugs, to improve both their stability and their release kinetics, there are an increasing number of research articles concerning aerogels in different drug delivery applications. This review presents an up to date overview of the advances in all kinds of aerogel based drug delivery systems which are currently under investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In pressure-driven membrane processes (reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration) a pressure exerted on the solution at one side of the membrane serves as a driving force to separate it into a permeate and a retentate. The permeate is usually pure water, whereas the retentate is a concentrated solution that must be disposed of or treated by other methods. Membranes may be polymeric, organo-mineral, ceramic, or metallic, and filtration techniques differ in pore size, from dense (no pores) to porous membranes. Depending on the type of technique, salts, small organic molecules, macromolecules, or particles can be retained, and the applied pressure will differ. This paper reviews the principles behind the different techniques, the types of membranes used, rejection mechanisms, and process modeling. Applications of pressure-driven membrane processes are also considered, including reverse osmosis and nanofiltration for the treatment of waste-water from landfills and composting plants, nanofiltration in the textile industry, and ultrafiltration and microfiltration in drinking water production and wastewater treatment. Lastly, the paper discusses recent developments, including techniques to prevent membrane fouling by modifications affecting surface roughness or hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, or by cleaning the membranes, and methods for treating or disposing of the retentate.}

By redefining the thermal efficiency, the Schofield method could be adapted to describe the flux without prior knowledge of membrane porosity, thickness, or thermal conductivity. A total of 17 commercially available membranes were analyzed in terms of flux and thermal efficiency to assess their suitability for application in MD. The model described the flux with an average \%RMSE of 4.5\%, which was in the same range as the standard deviation of the measured flux. The redefinition of the thermal efficiency also enabled MD to be used as a novel thermal conductivity measurement device for thin porous hydrophobic films that cannot be measured with the conventional laser flash diffusivity technique.},

However, current injectables suffer from mechanical mismatch with tissue, fragility, water expulsion, and high viscosity. To address these issues, we design brush-like macromolecules that concurrently provide softness, firmness, strength, fluidity, and swellability. The synthesized linear-bottlebrush-linear (LBL) copolymers facilitate improved injectability as the compact conformation of bottlebrush blocks results in low solution viscosity, while the thermoresponsive linear blocks permit prompt gelation at 37{$^\circ$}C. The resulting hydrogels mimic the deformation response of supersoft tissues such as adipose and brain while withstanding deformations of 700\% and precluding water expulsion upon gelation. Given their low cytotoxicity and mild inflammation in vivo, the developed materials will have vital implications for reconstructive surgery, tissue engineering, and drug delivery applications.           ,              Minimally invasive injection yields robust hydrogels that mimic the mechanics and water fraction of surrounding tissue.},

  abstract = {The escalating volume of oily wastewater, particularly produced water, necessitates efficient means of treatment for the recovery of both the water and oil constituents. Towards this end, membrane distillation (MD) is a promising candidate. Unfortunately, studies on the MD of oil emulsions are scarce, in large part because of membrane pore-wetting issues, which undermines the separation of oil and water. An earlier experimental study has indicated that membrane pore-wetting is caused by the presence of surfactant (namely, SDS) and salt (namely, NaCl), rather than oil, but the mechanisms underlying the poor performance remains unknown. Therefore, in order to improve the feasibility of MD, this molecular dynamics study is targeted at revealing the complex interactions that are detrimental to MD performance. The interactions of the three key constituents in produced water (namely, surfactant, oil and salt) among themselves and with the membrane are studied. The worst membrane pore-wetting experimentally observed for feeds containing SDS and NaCl is because NaCl increased the SDS-PVDF affinity without decreasing the mobility of SDS, and thereby leads to decreased surface tension and the increased likelihood of exceeding the liquid entry pressure (LEP). Accordingly, in order to mitigate pore-wetting in the membrane distillation of such feeds, means towards reducing the surfactant-membrane affinity, rather than oil-membrane affinity, and surfactant mobility near the membrane are recommended.},

Heat transfer property of textile materials is a major concern since it influences comfort properties of clothing. In this paper, numerical simulation was applied to evaluate the heat flux, temperature distributions, and convective heat transfer coefficients of the fibrous insulating materials treated with aerogel. The computational model simulated the insulation behavior of nonwoven fabrics without and with aerogel. Ansys and Comsol were used to model and simulate heat transfer. The simulation was performed assuming laminar flow and since the Mach number was {$<$} 0.3, the compressible flow model with Mach number {$<$} 0.3 was used. The results of simulation were correlated to experimental measurements for validation. Furthermore, aerogel-treated fabric samples showed better thermal performance. Using this model, the heat transfer properties of the nonwoven fabrics treated with aerogel can be optimized further.},

  abstract = {The wing surfaces of 97 insect species from virtually all relevant major groups were examined by high resolution scanning-electron-microscopy, in order to identify the relationships between the wing microstructures, their wettability with water and their behaviour under the influence of contamination. Isolated wings with contact angles between 31.6{$^\circ$} and 155.5{$^\circ$} were artificially contaminated with silicate dusts and subsequently fogged until drops of water (``dew'') formed and rolled off. The remaining particles were counted via a digital image analysis system. Remaining particle values between 0.41\% and 103\% were determined in comparison with unfogged controls. Some insects with very unwettable wings show a highly significant ``self-cleaning'' effect under the influence of rain or dew. Detailed analysis revealed that there is a correlation between the wettability and the ``SM Index'' (quotient of wing surface/(body mass)0.67) with values ranging from 2.42 to 57.0. Furthermore, there is a correlation between the ``self-cleaning'' effect and the SM Index, meaning that taxa with a high SM Index, e.g. ``large-winged'' Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Planipennia, and many Lepidoptera, have very unwettable wings and show high particle removal due to dripping water drops. The ``small-winged'' insects, such as Diptera and Hymenoptera, and insects with elytra, such as Blattariae, Saltatoria, Heteroptera and Coleoptera, show completely opposite effects. This is clearly a result of the fact that species with a high SM Index are, in principle, more restricted in flight by contamination than species with a low SM Index which can also actively clean their own wings. The wings primarily serve a protection function in insects with elytra, so that the effects of contamination are probably of minor importance in these insects.

Although less clearly defined, the collective results from all three characterization methods point to a comparably tilted structure for the shorter chain monolayers. The chain tilts at Ag are markedly different from the {\textasciitilde}30{$^\circ$} tilts for long-chain n-alkanethiolate monolayers at Au,4,10 indicating a difference in the bonding of the sulfur head group at the two metals. For short-chain monolayers, the offset of an odd-even effect by one methylene group at Ag with respect to Au for both the contact angle and IRS data further supports this conclusion. Models that are based on the crystallinity and the electronic properties of the two substrates are presented as possible explanations of the observed structures. These results demonstrate the potential of long-chain thiolate monolayers at Ag as a model molecular system for unraveling the complexities of a variety of interfacial processes. {\copyright} 1991, American Chemical Society.

  abstract = {Robust membrane hydrophobicity is crucial in membrane distillation (MD) to produce clean water, yet challenged by wetting phenomenon. We herein proposed a robust superhydrophobization process, by~making use of a carbon nanotube (CNT) intermediate layer over commercial hydrophobic membrane, indirectly grafting the low-surface-energy material 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (FAS),~with the achieved membrane~denoted as PVDF-CNT-FAS, in systematic comparison with direct grafting FAS on alkalinized PVDF denoted as PVDF-OH-FAS. Superhydrophobicity with water contact angle of 180{$^\circ$} was easily achieved from initial hydrophilic interface for both two resultant membranes. Interestingly, the existence of a CNT intermediate layer significantly maintained the stable hydrophobicity in various harsh conditions and improved mechanical properties, at an expense of ca. 20\% smaller pore size and extended membrane thickness than PVDF-OH-FAS. In the MD experiment, the PVDF-CNT-FAS exhibited no vapor flux sacrifice, giving constant flux with the control and doubled that for PVDF-OH-FAS. A mass-heat transfer modeling suggested no significant heat loss but facilitated vapor flux with the CNT layer, unlike the impeded transfer for the counterpart~membrane. A superior wetting resistance against 0.4 mM SDS further confirmed the benefit of constructing the CNT intermediate layer, presumably because of its excellent slippery property. This study demonstrates the important role of the CNT intermediate layer toward robust superhydrophobic membrane, suggesting the interest of applying the functional nanomaterial for controllable interface design.},

  abstract = {When a tunnel is constructed in a karst area, crystallization of the drainage pipe caused by karst water often threatens the normal operation of the tunnel. This work contributes to this field of research by proposing a functional model based on the diffusion boundary layer (DBL) theory proposed by Dreybrodt in the 1990s. The model is formed by determining the flow rate distribution of the drainage pipe in a laminar flow state and turbulent state, and then by applying Fick's diffusion law and Skelland's approximate formula. Then, to further verify the applicability of the functional model, a model test was carried out in the laboratory and the test results are compared to the theoretical results. The results show that the crystallization rate of karst water is mainly affected by the roughness of the pipe wall, followed by the slope of pipes. The slope can affect flow state by controlling the flow rate, which in turn affects the crystallization rate of karst water. When the slope of the drainage pipe is 3, 4, and 5\%, the error between the experimental results and the theoretical calculation results is 24.7, 8.07, and 27.9\%, respectively, and when the liquid level in the pipe is 7.2, 10.2, and 13.3 mm, the error is 27.9, 9.82, and 2.07\%, respectively. Considering that the flow will take away the crystalline deposits on the pipe wall in the experiment, although some results have certain errors, they do not affect the overall regularity.},

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to design novel multi-layer neural networks for multiscale simulations of flows taking into account the observed fine data and physical modeling concepts. Our approaches use deep learning techniques combined with local multiscale model reduction methodologies to predict flow dynamics. Using reduced-order model concepts is important for constructing robust deep learning architectures since the reduced-order models provide fewer degrees of freedom. We consider flow dynamics in porous media as multi-layer networks in this work. More precisely, the solution (e.g., pressures and saturation) at the time instant n + 1 depends on the solution at the time instant n and input parameters, such as permeability fields, forcing terms, and initial conditions. One can regard the solution as a multi-layer network, where each layer, in general, is a nonlinear forward map and the number of layers relates to the internal time steps. We will rely on rigorous model reduction concepts to define unknowns and connections between layers. It is critical to use reduced-order models for this purpose, which will identify the regions of influence and the appropriate number of variables. Furthermore, due to the lack of available observed fine data, the reduced-order model can provide us sufficient inexpensive data as needed. The designed deep neural network will be trained using both coarse simulation data which is obtained from the reduced-order model and observed fine data. We will present the main ingredients of our approach and numerical examples. Numerical results show that using deep learning with data generated from multiscale models as well as available observed fine data, we can obtain an improved forward map which can better approximate the fine scale model.

In Digital Core Analysis, a common tool in Earth Sciences, imaging the nano-and micro-scale structure of the pore space of rocks can be enhanced past hardware limitations, while identification of minerals and phases can be automated, with reduced bias and high physical accuracy. Traditional numerical methods for estimating petrophysical parameters and simulating flow and transport can be accelerated or replaced by neural networks. Techniques and common neural network architectures used in Digital Core Analysis are described with a review of recent studies to illustrate the wide range of tasks that benefit from Deep Learning. Focus is placed on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for segmentation in pore-scale imaging, the use of CNNs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in image quality enhancement and generation, and the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and CNNs for pore-scale physics modeling. Current limitations and challenges are discussed, including advances in network implementations, applications to unconventional resources, dataset acquisition and synthetic training, extrapolative potential, accuracy loss from soft computing, and the computational cost of 3D Deep Learning. Future directions of research are also discussed, focusing on the standardization of datasets and performance metrics, integrated workflow solutions, and further studies in multiphase flow predictions, such as CO2 trapping. The use of Deep Learning at the pore-scale will likely continue becoming increasingly pervasive, as potential exists to improve all aspects of the data-driven workflow, with higher image quality, automated processing, and faster simulations.},

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have produced accurate pixelwise semantic (multi-category) segmentation results with natural images and mu CT rock images, however, physical accuracy is not well documented. The performance of 4 CNN architectures is tested for 2D and 3D cases in 10 configurations. Manually segmented mu CT images of Mt. Simon Sandstone guided by QEMSCANs are treated as ground truth and used as training and validation data, with a high voxelwise accuracy (over 99\%) achieved. Downstream analysis is used to validate physical accuracy. The topology of each mineral is measured, the pore space absolute permeability and single/mixed wetting multiphase flow is modelled with direct simulation. These physical measures show high variance, with models that achieve 95\%+ in voxelwise accuracy possessing permeabilities and connectivities orders of magnitude off. A network architecture is introduced as a hybrid fusion of U-Net and ResNet, combining short and long skip connections in a Network-in-Network configuration, which overall outperforms U-Net and ResNet variants in some minerals, while outperforming SegNet in all minerals in voxelwise and physical accuracy measures. The network architecture and the dataset volume fractions influence accuracy trade-off since sparsely occurring minerals are over-segmented by lower accuracy networks such as SegNet at the expense of under-segmenting other minerals which can be alleviated with loss weighting. This is an especially important consideration when training a physically accurate model for segmentation. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, in this paper, it is reported that a strong electrolyte (HCl, LiOH, LiCl, LiBr, KCl, or KBr) can destabilize the GO solution, causing GO precipitation. This indicates that the electrostatic repulsion plays a critical role in stabilizing aqueous GO solution. The electrolyte-induced precipitates were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The oxygen-containing functional groups of GO sheets, which are carboxyl, epoxy, and hydroxyl groups, remained unchanged during acid (HCl)- and salt (LiCl)-induced precipitations. In contrast, during the GO precipitation induced by a base (LiOH), the carboxyl group of GO sheets disappeared with a remarkable increase in hydroxyl group and aromatic C@C bonds. This indicates that the LiOH-induced GO precipitation resulted in the partial reduction of GO sheets. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the HCl-induced GO precipitation is a feasible approach to deposit GO on a substrate as a Pt-free counter electrode for a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), which exhibited 1.65\% power conversion efficiency.},

In this work, we first introduce the synthesis and microstructure control method for GA, including pore size control, anisotropic pore structure control, and heterostructure control. The methods for measuring the thermal conductivity of bulk GAs in air (apparent k) and the k of solid matrix of GAs are introduced in detail, respectively. Finally, we review the thermal transport models for GAs, including the air--solid coupling models, models for calculating the intrinsic thermal properties of graphene nanoflakes, as well as the thermal reffusivity model and dominating thermal contact resistance model. Challenges and opportunities in the study of thermal transport in 3D GAs are discussed. Considering the remarkable complexity of physical/chemical structure of GAs, there is still a large room in understanding fundamentals of energy transport in these three-dimensional graphene networks, which will pave the way toward their novel applications in the near future.},

The prepared composite membrane showed an asymmetric wettability, the coating surface was underwater oleophobic with underwater oil contact angle of 148.7{$^\circ$} and the PTFE substrate surface was hydrophobic with in-air water contact angle of 134.5{$^\circ$}. The test results of the adhesive force between an oil droplet and membrane surface exhibited that the fabricated membrane had a desirable surface to resist oil adhesion. Direct contact MD experiments were conducted using a saline emulsion with 1000\,mg/L crude oil to compare the performance of the modified membrane and the pristine PTFE membrane. The results demonstrated that the modified membrane can present stable performance with robust resistance to oil-fouling compared to the pristine PTFE membrane.

Compared to superomniphobic surfaces with single-scale re-entrant structures, this superomniphobic surface with DRSs shows highly improved repellency against the impact from different high-pressured droplets, a property which is furnished by the extension of three-phase contact lines, the increase in local geometric angles, and the formation of additional air pockets. Furthermore, the superomniphobic surface can serve as a platform to well maintain lubricating fluid so as to realize a photoresponsive slippery surface wherein near-infrared light can be used to manipulate various liquid droplets with a large range of volumes. Overall, this study provides a strategy for obtaining the robust superomniphobic and photoresponsive slippery surfaces through the DRS design, which provides a new insight into enhancing the dynamic stability of superomniphobic surfaces and also demonstrates the application of slippery surfaces for droplet manipulation.},

Compared with short bonds, long CNTs play a reinforcing role at a larger tensile strain, leading to larger tensile strength and toughness. Under compression, the sliding and rotation of graphene sheets in CbGrF are prevented by long CNTs, resulting in higher compressive stiffness than that of pure GrFs. Furthermore, the tensile and compressive moduli increase by more than 300\% with increasing thickness of graphene sheets from 1 to 9 layers; they increase by no more than 50\% as the CNT bending stiffness increases and are almost independent of the stretching stiffness of CNTs. These results should be helpful for understanding the tunability of GrFs using both short and long crosslinkers and guiding the preparation of advanced GrF-based composites.},

  abstract = {Pore wetting is a unique and important technical challenge that can lead to process failure in membrane distillation (MD) using hydrophobic membranes. While it is well known that both low-surface-tension and water miscible liquids, such as alcohols, and amphiphilic molecules, such as surfactants, are effective wetting agents, the detailed mechanisms for these agents to induce pore wetting remain unclear. In particular, the role of surface adsorption in surfactant-induced wetting remains to be elucidated. This study provides fundamental insights to understanding the mechanism of pore wetting induced by these two different wetting agents. Using a recently developed wetting monitoring technique based on single-frequency transmembrane impedance, we experimentally probe the kinetics of wetting frontier propagation. We demonstrate that ethanol-induced wetting is instantaneous whereas surfactant-induced wetting is dynamic with its kinetic rate dependent on several critical factors. We also develop a theoretical model, based on the assumption of quasi-equilibrium adsorption, to successfully explain the important features experimentally observed in surfactant-induced wetting. Specifically, it was found that the kinetics of surfactant-induced wetting strongly depends on the vapor flux and the bulk concentration of surfactants in the feed solution, but surprisingly not on the transmembrane hydraulic pressure difference. The results from our study also suggest that while the presence of surfactants promotes wetting, adsorption of surfactants onto pore surface actually deters pore wetting instead of promoting it by rendering the surface hydrophilic.},

However, scalable fabrication methods to produce mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with good flexibility and ultrahigh MOF loading are urgently needed yet largely unmet. Herein, we report a thermally induced phase separation-hot pressing (TIPS-HoP) strategy to roll-to-roll produce 10 distinct MOF-membranes (loadings up to 86\,wt\%). Ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene interweaving the MOF particles contributes to their mechanical strength.

  abstract = {Membrane scaling and wetting severely hinder practical applications of membrane distillation (MD) for hypersaline water/wastewater treatment. In this regard, the effects of feedwater constituents are still not well understood. Herein, we investigated how humic acid (HA) influenced gypsum-induced membrane scaling and wetting during MD desalination. At low concentrations (5-20 mg L-1), HA notably mitigated membrane scaling and wetting. The morphological characterization of scaled membranes revealed that the antiwetting behavior could be ascribed to the formation of a compact and protective gypsum/ HA scale layer, which blocked the flow channel of scaling ions and suppressed the intrusion of scale particles into membrane pores. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the scaling process, the formation of the scale layer was related to the heterogeneous crystallization of gypsum on the membrane surface. Moreover, deprotonated HA interfered with the heterogeneous crystallization process by inhibiting the formation of gypsum nuclei and altering the orientation of crystal growth, thus delaying membrane scaling and altering the morphology of the scale layer. Thermodynamic and kinetic analyses further demonstrated the mitigation mechanism of HA. Furthermore, improved fouling reversibility and antiwetting ability in synthetic seawater treatment endowed by HA were observed. This study provides new insight into the roles played by the organic constituents of water/wastewater during membrane desalination, providing a valuable reference for developing novel strategies to improve the performance of MD.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new meta-modeling framework that employs deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate mechanical constitutive models for interfaces. The constitutive models are conceptualized as information flow in directed graphs. The process of writing constitutive models is simplified as a sequence of forming graph edges with the goal of maximizing the model score (a function of accuracy, robustness and forward prediction quality). Thus meta-modeling can be formulated as a Markov decision process with well-defined states, actions, rules, objective functions and rewards. By using neural networks to estimate policies and state values, the computer agent is able to efficiently self-improve the constitutive model it generated through self-playing, in the same way AlphaGo Zero (the algorithm that outplayed the world champion in the game of Go) improves its gameplay. Our numerical examples show that this automated meta-modeling framework does not only produces models which outperform existing cohesive models on benchmark traction-separation data, but is also capable of detecting hidden mechanisms among micro-structural features and incorporating them in constitutive models to improve the forward prediction accuracy, both of which are difficult tasks to do manually.

This study outlines an integrated method combining predictions of fluid flow (fast, limited accuracy) with direct flow simulation (slow, high accuracy) is outlined that reduces computation time by an order of magnitude without loss of accuracy. A convolutional neural network (CNNs) is trained with various configurations on simulations in 2D and 3D porous media to estimate steady state velocity fields. Permeability estimation (as an average of the field) is accurate, but the velocity fields themselves are error prone, unsuitable for further transport studies. This estimate can either be used as an indicative prediction, or as initial conditions in direct simulation to reach a fully accurate result in a fraction of the compute time. Using Deep Learning predictions (or potentially any other approximation method) to accelerate flow simulation to steady state in complex structures shows promise as a technique to push the boundaries fluid flow modelling.},

  abstract = {Many geological materials, such as shale, mudstone, carbonate rock, limestone and rock salt are multi-porosity porous media in which pores of different scales may co-exist in the host matrix. When fractures propagate in these multi-porosity materials, these pores may enlarge and coalesce and therefore change the magnitude and the principal directions of the effective permeability tensors. The pore-fluid inside the cracks and the pores of host matrix may interact and exchange fluid mass, but the difference in hydraulic properties of these pores often means that a single homogenized effective permeability tensor field is insufficient to characterize the evolving hydraulic properties of these materials at smaller time scale. Furthermore, the complexity of the hydro-mechanical coupling process and the induced mechanical and hydraulic anisotropy originated from the micro-fracture and plasticity at grain scale also makes it difficult to propose, implement and validate separated macroscopic constitutive laws for numerical simulations. This article presents a hybrid data-driven method designed to capture the multiscale hydro-mechanical coupling effect of porous media with pores of various different sizes. At each scale, data-driven models generated from supervised machine learning are hybridized with classical constitutive laws in a directed graph that represents the numerical models. By using sub-scale simulations to generate database to train material models, an offline homogenization procedure is used to replace the up-scaling procedure to generate cohesive laws for localized physical discontinuities at both grain and specimen scales. Through a proper homogenization procedure that preserves spatial length scales, the proposed method enables field-scale simulations to gather insights from meso-scale and grain-scale micro-structural attributes. This method is proven to be much more computationally efficient than the classical DEM-FEM or FEM2 approach while at the same time more robust and flexible than the classical surrogate modeling approach. Due to the usage of bridging-scale technique, the proposed model may provide multiple opportunities to incorporate different types of simulations and experimental data across different length scales for machine learning. Numerical issues will also be discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The three-dimensional high-resolution imaging of rock samples is the basis for pore-scale characterization of reservoirs. Micro X-ray computed tomography (mu-CT) is considered the most direct means of obtaining the three-dimensional inner structure of porous media without deconstruction. The micrometer resolution of mu-CT, however, limits its application in the detection of small structures such as nanochannels, which are critical for fluid transportation. An effective strategy for solving this problem is applying numerical reconstruction methods to improve the resolution of the mu-CT images. In this paper, a convolutional neural network reconstruction method is introduced to reconstruct high-resolution porous structures based on low-resolution mu-CT images and high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. The proposed method involves four steps. First, a three-dimensional low-resolution tomographic image of a rock sample is obtained by mu-CT scanning. Next, one or more sections in the rock sample are selected for scanning by SEM to obtain high-resolution two-dimensional images. The high-resolution segmented SEM images and their corresponding low-resolution mu-CT slices are then applied to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Finally, the trained CNN model is used to reconstruct the entire low-resolution three-dimensional mu-CT image. Because the SEM images are segmented and have a higher resolution than the mu-CT image, this algorithm integrates the super-resolution and segmentation processes. The input data are low-resolution mu-CT images, and the output data are high-resolution segmented porous structures. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract = {Effective diffusivity is one of the basic transport coefficients used to describe the mass transport capability of a porous medium. In this study, a deep learning method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) with sample structure information self-amplification is proposed to predict the effective diffusivity of a porous medium, which is considerably influenced by the morphological and topological parameters of the porous medium. In this method, the geometric structures of three-dimensional (3D) porous media are reproduced via a stochastic reconstruction method. Datasets of the effective diffusivities of the reconstructed porous media were first established by the pore-scale lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) simulation. A large number of geometric structures of 3D porous media are obtained using the proposed sample structure information self-amplification approach. The 3D geometric structure information and corresponding effective diffusivities are directionally applied to a CNN for training and prediction. The effective diffusivities of media with porosities ranging from 0.48 to 0.58 are employed as training datasets, and the effective diffusivities of media with a broader porosity range of 0.39 to 0.79 are predicted by CNN. The CNN model can achieve a fast and accurate prediction of the effective diffusivity. The relative error between the CNN and LBM is 0.026\%--8.95\% with porosities ranging from 0.39 to 0.79. For a typical case with a porosity of 0.5, the computation time required by the CNN model is only 3 {\texttimes} 10-4 h, while the computation time for the same case is 16.96 h using the LBM. These findings indicate that the proposed deep learning method has a powerful learning ability; it is time-saving, provides accurate predictions, and can serve as a promising and powerful tool to predict the transport coefficients of complex porous media.},

As one of the most promising types of functional surfaces, the reported anisotropic slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPSs) demonstrate unique advantages in liquid directional transportation. However, anisotropic SLIPSs readily suffer from the depletion of lubricant when used to manipulate droplets and bubbles, which leads to unstable surface properties. Therefore, fabricating stable anisotropic slippery surfaces for the directional transportation of drops and bubbles remains a challenge. Here, stable anisotropic covalently grafted slippery surfaces are fabricated by grafting polydimethylsiloxane molecular brushes onto directional microgrooved surfaces. The fabricated surfaces show remarkable anisotropic omniphobic sliding behaviors towards droplets with different surface tensions ranging from 72.8 to 37.7 mN m(-1) in air and towards bubbles underwater. Impressively, the surface maintains outstanding stability for the transportation of droplets (in air) and air bubbles (underwater) even after 240 d. Furthermore, anisotropic self-cleaning towards various dust particles in air and directional bubble collection underwater are achieved on this surface. This stable anisotropic slippery surface has great potential for applications in the directional transportation of liquids and bubbles, microfluidic devices, directional drag reduction, directional antifouling, and beyond.},

  abstract = {In previous studies of the desalination technology membrane distillation (MD), superhydrophobicity of the membrane has been shown to dramatically decrease fouling in adverse conditions, but the mechanism for this is not well understood. Additionally, air layers present on submerged solid superhydrophobic surfaces have been shown to dramatically reduce biofouling, and air-bubbling has been used to reducing fouling and increase flux and efficiency in MD. The present work studies the effect of maintaining air layers on the membrane surface and superhydrophobicity as a new method for preventing fouling of MD membranes by salts, particulates, and organic particles. Superhydrophobic MD membranes were prepared using initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) of perfluorodecyl acrylate (PFDA) on poly(vinyldene fluoride) PVDF membranes and used to study the effects of surface energy on fouling. A static MD setup with evaporation through an MD membrane but no condensing of permeate was used to examine the effect of air exposure on fouling, by measuring the increase in weight of the membrane caused by scale deposition. Theory was derived for the reduction of fouling on superhydrophobic surfaces, and a review of related theory was included. Air layers may displace fouling gels, reduce the area of feed in contact with the membrane, reduce foulant adhesion, and enhance superhydrophobicity in a Cassie--Baxter state. The study shows that the presence of air on the membrane surface significantly reduces biological fouling, but in some cases had mildly exacerbating effects by increasing crystal formation of salts, especially when the air was not saturated with water vapor. Air recharging combined with superhydrophobicity reduced fouling in several cases where hydrophobic membranes alone did little.},

  abstract = {The thermal performance of air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) desalination is dominated by heat and mass transfer across the air gap between the membrane and the condensing surface. However, little is known about the impact of condensate flow patterns in some design variations of the air gap. In this study, air gap membrane distillation experiments were performed at various inlet temperatures, varying module inclination angle, condensing surface hydrophobicity, and gap spacer design to identify the effect of each on the permeate production rate and thermal efficiency of the system. Additionally, this study is one of the first with enhanced visualization of flow patterns within the air gap itself, by using a transparent, high thermal conductivity sapphire plate as the condenser surface. System-level numerical modeling is used to further understand the impact of these flow regimes on overall energy efficiency, including flux and GOR. A brief review of membrane distillation condensation regimes is provided as well. For tilting the AGMD flat-plate module, permeate flux was barely influenced except at extreme positive angles ({$>$} 80{$^\circ$}), and moderate negative angles ({$<$} -30{$^\circ$}), where condensate fell onto the membrane surface. The surface with the hydrophobic coating (for dropwise condensation) was shown to have better droplet shedding (with very small nearly spherical droplets) and fewer droplets bridging the gap. Superhydrophobic surfaces (for jumping droplet condensation) were similar, with much smaller droplet sizes. Such surfaces could improve AGMD efficiency while avoiding flooding, as better performance (2x higher GOR) is reached with much smaller gap sizes ({$<$}0.2 mm) than currently attainable gaps with filmwise condensation ({$>$}1 mm). Meanwhile, the hydrophilic surface for small gap sizes ({$<$} 3\,mm) often had pinned regions of water around the hydrophilic surface and plastic spacer. Overall, the various results imply that the common assumption of a laminar condensate film poorly describes the flow patterns in real systems for all tilt angles and most spacer designs. Real system performance is likely to be between that of pure AGMD and permeate gap membrane distillation (PGMD) variants, and modeling shows that enhanced condensing in air gaps may improve system energy efficiency significantly, with strong relative advantages at high salinity.},

  abstract = {Enhanced fouling resistance has been observed in recent variants of reverse osmosis (RO) desalination which use time-varying batch or semi-batch processes, such as closed-circuit RO (CCRO) and pulse flow RO (PFRO). However, the mechanisms of batch processes' fouling resistance are not well-understood, and models have not been developed for prediction of their fouling performance. Here, a framework for predicting reverse osmosis fouling is developed by comparing the fluid residence time in batch and continuous (conventional) reverse osmosis systems to the nucleation induction times for crystallization of sparingly soluble salts. This study considers the inorganic foulants calcium sulfate (gypsum), calcium carbonate (calcite), and silica, and the work predicts maximum recovery ratios for the treatment of typical water sources using batch reverse osmosis (BRO) and continuous reverse osmosis. The prediction method is validated through comparisons to the measured time delay for CaSO4 membrane scaling in a bench-scale, recirculating reverse osmosis unit. The maximum recovery ratio for each salt solution (CaCO3, CaSO4) is individually predicted as a function of inlet salinity, as shown in contour plots. Next, the maximum recovery ratios of batch and conventional RO are compared across several water sources, including seawater, brackish groundwater, and RO brine. Batch RO's shorter residence times, associated with cycling from low to high salinity during each batch, enable significantly higher recovery ratios and higher salinity than in continuous RO for all cases examined. Finally, representative brackish RO brine samples were analyzed to determine the maximum possible recovery with batch RO. Overall, the induction time modeling methodology provided here can be used to allow batch RO to operate at high salinity and high recovery, while controlling scaling. The results show that, in addition to its known energy efficiency improvement, batch RO has superior inorganic fouling resistance relative to conventional RO.},

  abstract = {The critical failure mode for membrane distillation (MD) desalination is wetting through the pores of the hydrophobic membrane, which allows the saline solution to leak through and contaminate the permeate. The standard practice for reversing membrane wetting is to dry out the membrane for several hours before resuming the desalination process. An alternative method for mitigating MD membrane wetting is examined in this study, wherein pressurized air is pushed through the membrane from the permeate side for several seconds, forcing trapped water out before it can evaporate. To compare the wetting reversal methods, the liquid entry pressure (LEP) was surpassed with saline water at varied salinity. Then, either a 24+ hour dryout, a 10 second pressurized air treatment, or both were applied, followed by remeasuring the LEP. Pressurized air backwashing restored the LEP to 75\% of the original value for lower salinity feeds. The backwashing method is hypothesized to achieve this superior result because it removes saline solution from the membrane without separating water and salts by vaporization, whereas the dryout method causes seawater within the membrane to evaporate, leaving crystalline solutes trapped within the membrane. Such trapped particles may act as a path for rewetting, and also impair permeate flux and system energy efficiency. For all three methods, membranes tested with higher salinity water had lower LEP restoration irrespective of the restoration technique used. A method for testing LEP with more accuracy was also developed, using stepwise pressure increases. SEM images showed that the restoration methods did not alter the membranes themselves, although there remains a possibility that the air backwashing can cause superficial tears.},

One principal challenge for MD is scaling and fouling contamination of the membrane, which has gained growing attention in the literature recently as well. The present paper surveys the published literature on MD membrane fouling. The goal of this work is to synthesize the key fouling conditions, fouling types, harmful effects, and mitigation techniques to provide a basis for future technology development. The investigation includes physical, thermal and flow conditions that affect fouling, types of fouling, mechanisms of fouling, fouling differences by sources of water, system design, effects of operating parameters, prevention, cleaning, membrane damage, and future trends. Finally, numerical modeling of the heat and mass transfer processes has been used to calculate the saturation index at the MD membrane interface and is used to better understand and explain some of trends reported in literature.},

  abstract = {A methodology for predicting scaling in membrane distillation (MD), which considers thermodynamics, kinetics, and fluid mechanics, is developed and experimentally validated with calcium sulfate. The theory predicts the incidence of scaling as a function of temperature, concentration, and flow conditions by comparing the nucleation induction time to the residence time and applying an experimental correction factor. The relevant residence time is identified by considering a volume of solution near the membrane surface that contains enough ions to form a nucleus of critical size. The theory is validated with fouling experiments using calcium sulfate as a model scalant over a range of temperatures (40--70{$^\circ$}C), saturation indices, and flow rates. Although the model is validated with a bench-scale MD system, it is hoped to be compatible with large-scale systems that may have significant changes in concentration, temperature, and flow rate along the flow direction. At lower temperatures, the saturation index can be as high as 0.4--0.5 without scaling, but the safe concentration limit decreases with increasing temperature. Increasing the feed flow rate reduces concentration polarization and fluid residence time, both of which decrease the likelihood of fouling. The model is translated into easily readable maps outlining safe operating regimes for MD. The theory and maps can be used to choose safe operating conditions in MD over a wide range of conditions and system geometries.},

We combine modular synthesis, electrochemical characterization, and molecular simulation to investigate lithiumion transport in a new family of polyester-based polymers and in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). Theoretical predictions of glasstransition temperatures and ionic conductivities in the polymers agree well with experimental measurements. Interestingly, both the experiments and simulations indicate that the ionic conductivity of PEO, relative to the polyesters, is far higher than would be expected from its relative glass-transition temperature. The simulations reveal that diffusion of the lithium cations in the polyesters proceeds via a different mechanism than in PEO, and analysis of the distribution of available cation solvation sites in the various polymers provides a novel and intuitive way to explain the experimentally observed ionic conductivities. This work provides a platform for the evaluation and prediction of ionic conductivities in polymer electrolyte materials.},

Plasma surface modification conditions were optimized with respect to plasma glow discharge power and treatment duration using a flat sheet PES membrane. The modified membranes were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), SEM, contact angle measurements, pore size distribution, liquid entry pressure and atomic force microscopy. Results revealed that the plasma modification converted hydrophilic membranes of a contact angle 0{$^\circ$} into hydrophobic ones with water contact angle above 120{$^\circ$}. Fluorination was ascribed to the wettability change of the membrane from hydrophilic to hydrophobic via insertion and possibly deposition. Direct contact membrane distillation of the hollow fibers using 4\% NaCl solution yielded a water flux of 45.4kg/m2h at a feed temperature of 63.3{$^\circ$}C. A rather high evaporation efficiency of the membrane distillation process was estimated in comparison with literature results. Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) stability test showed a water flux of 42.1kg/m2h using 4wt\% NaCl as feed (at the temperature of 60.5{\textpm}0.2{$^\circ$}C). No leakage was observed for 54h indicating a stable membrane performance. The high evaporation efficiency and water flux were ascribed most probably to the high porosity of the base membrane.},

The traditional methods to study effective thermal conductivities of composite materials, such as the effective medium theory, the direct solution of heat diffusion equation, or the Boltzmann transport equation, are all based on developing good physical understanding of heat transfer mechanisms in those composite materials. In this work, we take a completely different approach to predict the effective thermal conductivities of composite materials using machine learning methods. With a set of trustable data, the support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and convolution neural network (CNN) are employed to train models that can predict the effective thermal conductivities of composite materials. We find that the models obtained from SVR, GPR, and CNN all have a better performance than the Maxwell-Eucken model and the Bruggeman model in terms of predicting accuracy. Our work demonstrates that machine learning methods are useful tools to fast predict the effective thermal conductivities of composite materials and porous media if the training data set is available. The machine learning approach also has the potential to be generalized and applied to study other physical properties of composite materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Machine learning models trained with numerical simulation data can provide a faster alternative to traditional simulators. Here we present U-FNO, a novel neural network architecture for solving multiphase flow problems with superior accuracy, speed, and data efficiency. U-FNO is designed based on the newly proposed Fourier neural operator (FNO), which has shown excellent performance in single-phase flows. We extend the FNO-based architecture to a highly complex CO2-water multiphase problem with wide ranges of permeability and porosity heterogeneity, anisotropy, reservoir conditions, injection configurations, flow rates, and multiphase flow properties. The U-FNO architecture is more accurate in gas saturation and pressure buildup predictions than the original FNO and a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) benchmark. Meanwhile, it has superior data utilization efficiency, requiring only a third of the training data to achieve the equivalent accuracy as CNN. U-FNO provides superior performance in highly heterogeneous geological formations and critically important applications such as gas saturation and pressure buildup "fronts" determination. The trained model can serve as a general-purpose alternative to routine numerical simulations of 2D-radial CO2 injection problems with significant speed-ups than traditional simulators.},

The measurements were made in the absence of a gas phase in a newly developed eonductometric solubility apparatus. The temperature derivative of solubility of cd\&a at constant CO8 concentration varies from --1O-6 to -3 x 1O-6 moIEl{\textasciitilde}C, being a maximum for the highest CO, concentration and {\textasciitilde}mperatu{\textasciitilde}. The derivative of the solubilit{\textasciitilde} of calcite with respect to CO, oonc{\textasciitilde}ntration at constant temperature has a value approximately 1 at very low CO, concentrations and decreases as the COB concentration rises. At low CO, concentrations, the solubility of aragonite is the same as that of calcite within the experimental errors. At a CO* concentration of 1O-3 molal, aragonite is about 11 per cent more soluble than calcite.},

Progress in creating anti-ice and anti-frost surfaces has been particularly rapid since the discovery and development of slippery, liquid infused porous surfaces (SLIPS). Here we use SLIPS-coated differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) pans to investigate the effects of the surface modification on the nucleation of supercooled water. This investigation is inherently different from previous studies which looked at the adhesion of ice to SLIPS surfaces, or the formation of ice under high humidity conditions. Given the stochastic nature of nucleation of ice from supercooled water, multiple runs on the same sample are needed to determine if a given surface coating has a real and statistically significant effect on the nucleation temperature. We have cycled supercooling to freezing and then thawing of deionized water in hydrophilic (untreated aluminum), hydrophobic, superhydrophobic, and SLIPS-treated DSC pans multiple times to determine the effects of surface treatment on the nucleation and subsequent growth of ice. We find that SLIPS coatings lower the nucleation temperature of supercooled water in contact with statistical significance and show no deterioration or change in the coating performance even after 150 freeze-thaw cycles. {\copyright} the Owner Societies 2013.},

  abstract = {Creating a robust synthetic surface that repels various liquids would have broad technological implications for areas ranging from biomedical devices and fuel transport to architecture but has proved extremely challenging(1). Inspirations from natural non-wetting structures(2-6), particularly the leaves of the lotus, have led to the development of liquid-repellent microtextured surfaces that rely on the formation of a stable air-liquid interface(7-9). Despite over a decade of intense research, these surfaces are, however, still plagued with problems that restrict their practical applications: limited oleophobicity with high contact angle hysteresis(9), failure under pressure(10-12) and upon physical damage(1,7,11), inability to self-heal and high production cost(1,11). To address these challenges, here we report a strategy to create self-healing, slippery liquid-infused porous surface(s) (SLIPS) with exceptional liquid- and ice-repellency, pressure stability and enhanced optical transparency. Our approach-inspired by Nepenthes pitcher plants(13)-is conceptually different from the lotus effect, because we use nano/microstructured substrates to lock in place the infused lubricating fluid. We define the requirements for which the lubricant forms a stable, defect-free and inert 'slippery' interface. This surface outperforms its natural counterparts(2-6) and state-of-the-art synthetic liquid-repellent surfaces(8,9,14-16) in its capability to repel various simple and complex liquids (water, hydrocarbons, crude oil and blood), maintain low contact angle hysteresis ({$<$}2.5 degrees), quickly restore liquid-repellency after physical damage (within 0.1-1 s), resist ice adhesion, and function at high pressures (up to about 680 atm). We show that these properties are insensitive to the precise geometry of the underlying substrate, making our approach applicable to various inexpensive, low-surface-energy structured materials (such as porous Teflon membrane). We envision that these slippery surfaces will be useful in fluid handling and transportation, optical sensing, medicine, and as self-cleaning and antifouling materials operating in extreme environments.},

Transparent silica aerogels with densities spanning   0.05 to {$>$}0.32 g/cm3 were synthesized and the effects of density on the mechanical, microstructural, and thermal properties were studied. In the samples investigated, the elastic modulus E was found to vary from 40 kPa to 70 MPa, compressive strength rC from 500 kPa to 4.2 MPa, fracture strain eF from 9\% to {$>$}80\%, tensile strength rT from 11 kPa to 315 kPa, and thermal conductivity k from 13.5 mW/m K to 24.5 mW/m K. The failure mode of the aerogels was observed to be density dependent and transition with increasing density from ductile compaction to elastic deformation to brittle fracture. Within the density range where elastic behavior was observed, the compressive strength of the silica aerogels was measured to be roughly one order of magnitude higher than would be expected from brittle materials due to the materials ability to absorb energy; these aerogels recovered elastically after being subjected to compressive strains as high as 40\%. BET analysis using nitrogen adsorption revealed specific surface areas of  740--780 m2/g and average pore sizes in the range of 26--72 nm.},

  abstract = {Chemical cleaning of membranes is one of the most important strategies in pressurized hollow fiber ultrafiltration (UF) as a pre-treatment for seawater desalination. Various physical cleaning strategies such as backwashing, aeration and air-scrubbing or chemically enhanced backwashing (CEB) have been investigated in order to remove foulants from the UF membrane. However, the limitation in their cleaning effects being found during long-term operation leads to the need of cleaning in place (CIP) for the recovery of membrane performance. In this study, we used oxalic acid and sodium hypochlorite as chemical cleaning agents. The cleaning in series of oxalic acid--sodium hypochlorite--oxalic acid showed the optimal cleaning efficiency and was applied for the consecutive chemical cleaning. The recovery efficiency of the CIP after first, second, third and fourth cleanings was 96.8\%, 95.8\%, 98.3\% and 99.9\%, respectively. It was almost fully recovered to the previous recovered value. However, membrane surface structure was deformed by contact with chemical cleaning agents during cleaning time, because, hydrophilic inorganic foulants are still adhered on the membrane surface even after several cleanings although hydrophobic organic foulants were removed easily by chemical cleaning. An improved CIP strategy should be developed to remove hydrophilic foulants for long-term operation of desalination plants.},

In addition, we have modified CHARMM and Q-Chem to take advantage of the newly introduced replica path and the nudged elastic band methods, which are powerful techniques for studying reaction pathways in a highly parallel (i.e., parallel/parallel) fashion, with each pathway point being distributed to a different node of a large cluster. To test our implementation, a series of systems were studied and comparisons were made to both full QM calculations and previous QM/MM studies and experiments. For instance, the differences between HF, DFT, MP2, and CCSD QM/MM calculations of H2O{$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} H2O, H2O{$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} Na+, and H2O{$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} Cl- complexes have been explored. Furthermore, the recently implemented polarizable Drude water model was used to make comparisons to the popular TIP3P and TIP4P water models for doing QM/MM calculations. We have also computed the energetic profile of the chorismate mutase catalyzed Claisen rearrangement at various QM/MM levels of theory and have compared the results with previous studies. Our best estimate for the activation energy is 8.20 kcal/mol and for the reaction energy is -23.1 kcal/mol, both calculated at the MP2/6-31+G(d)//MP2/6-31+G(d)/C22 level of theory.},

While this strategy is highly suitable for portable and small scale water purification for individuals, families and those living in remote areas, the development of highly efficient and flexible photothermal materials which can be easily transported for storage and deliver is required. In this study, a commercial degreasing cotton, photothermal CuS yolk-shell nanocages and agarose were combined to produce a highly flexible photothermal aerogel which delivered a high energy efficiency (94.9\%) for solar-steam generation under 1.0\,sun irradiation, corresponding to a water evaporation rate of 1.63\,kg\,m-2 h-1. The preparation of the photothermal aerogel can be easily scaled up due to the simplicity of the applied casting method. The obtained aerogel showed excellent stability for solar steam generation with no degradation in performance after at least 15 cycles. The salinity of the clean water produced during solar-thermal desalination of seawater was only 0.54\,ppm. The raw materials of cotton, agarose and CuS are all cost effective, thus this flexible photothermal aerogel has showed great potential for practical application in portable solar-thermal evaporators.},

The optimized model performs well on porous media with realistic topology, large variation of porosity (0.28--0.98), and effective diffusivity spanning more than one order of magnitude (0.1 {$\lessequivlnt$}               D                                e                              {$<$} 1), e.g., {$>$}95\% of predicted               D               e               have truncated relative error of {$<$}10\% when the true               D               e               is larger than 0.2. The CNN model provides better prediction than the empirical Bruggeman equation, especially for porous structure with small diffusivity. The relative error of CNN predictions, however, is rather high for structures with               D               e               \,{$<$}\,0.1. To address this issue, the porosity of porous structures is encoded directly into the neural network but the performance is enhanced marginally. Further improvement, i.e., 70\% of the CNN predictions for structures with true               D               e               \,{$<$}\,0.1 have relative error {$<$}30\%, is achieved by removing trapped regions and dead-end pathways using a simple algorithm. These results suggest that deep learning augmented by field knowledge can be a powerful technique for predicting the transport properties of porous media. Directions for future research of machine learning in porous media are discussed based on detailed analysis of the performance of CNN models in the present work.},

First, the dispersed graphene oxide (GO) was locked homogeneously in those chains formed by the gelation of PPy. Then, a hydrothermal process was employed to reduce GO to RGO. With a trace content of RGO (0.43 wt\% in aerogel), the electromagnetic absorption (EA) performance had been significantly improved. Only with a very low filler loading (10 wt\%), the S-PPy/RGO aerogel based composite could reach an effective EA bandwidth (below -10 dB) of 6.76 GHz, and the highest reflection coefficient reached -54.4 dB at 12.76 GHz. It was demonstrated that this aerogel material can be considered as an effective route to design a lightweight and high performance EA material. Furthermore, the S-PPy/RGO aerogel also showed a suitable pollution treatment performance with different solvents and dyes.},

This article presents a framework that includes (1) generation of porous media samples, (2) computation of permeability via fluid dynamics simulations, (3) training of convolutional neural networks (CNN) with simulated data, and (4) validations against simulations. Comparison of machine learning results and the ground truths suggests excellent predictive performance across a wide range of porosities and pore geometries, especially for those with dilated pores. Owning to such heterogeneity, the permeability cannot be estimated using the conventional Kozeny-Carman approach. Computational time was reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to fluid dynamic simulations. We found that, by including physical parameters that are known to affect permeability into the neural network, the physics-informed CNN generated better results than regular CNN.

Recently developed solar steam generation relying on interfacial evaporators has high solar energy-to-steam efficiency (60--90\%), but its vapor collection efficiency is low, typically {\textasciitilde}30\%. Here, we present a solar-driven photothermal membrane distillation (PMD) system that offers easy and highly efficient clean vapor generation, condensation, and collection. The new photothermal membrane is thermally-engineered to incorporate a bilayer structure composed of two environmentally-sustainable materials, polydopamine (PDA) particles and bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), and it achieved a permeate flux of 1.0~kg~m-2~h-1 under 1 sun irradiation and a high solar energy-to-collected water efficiency of 68\%. The thermally-engineered strategy of using a bilayer structure ensures superb optical/photothermal activities, maximized membrane porosity ({\textasciitilde}93\%), and reduced conductive heat transfer, thus increasing the thermal efficiency of the membrane. The strong chemically-bonded fluorosilane functional groups on the membrane surface provide stable hydrophobicity and high salt rejection ({$>$}99.9\%). Moreover, under solar irradiation, the membrane shows effective interfacial photothermal disinfection to kill bacteria, enabling easy cleaning and increasing its lifespan. Using solar energy, the PMD system presented here can provide advantageous decentralized desalination for remote areas, and can support resilient community development.},

  abstract = {Scaling in membrane distillation (MD) is a key issue in desalination of concentrated saline water, where the interface property between the membrane and the feed become critical. In this paper, a slippery mechanism was explored as an innovative concept to understand the scaling behavior in membrane distillation for a soluble salt, NaCl. The investigation was based on a novel design of a superhydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane with micro-pillar arrays (MP-PVDF) using a micromolding phase separation (mPS) method. The membrane showed a contact angle of 166.0 {\textpm} 2.3  and the sliding angle of 15.8 {\textpm} 3.3 . After CF4 plasma treatment, the resultant membrane (CF4-MP-PVDF) showed a reduced sliding angle of 3.0 . In direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD), the CF4-MP-PVDF membrane illustrated excellent anti-scaling in concentrating saturated NaCl feed. Characterization of the used membranes showed that aggregation of NaCl crystals occurred on the control PVDF and MP-PVDF membranes, but not on the CF4-MP-PVDF membrane. To understand this phenomenon, a ``slippery'' theory was introduced and correlated the sliding angle to the slippery surface of CF4-MP-PVDF and its anti-scaling property. This work proposed a well-defined physical and theoretical platform for investigating scaling problems in membrane distillation and beyond.},

In this paper, we report a novel omniphobic micropillared membrane coated by silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) (SiNPs-MP-PVDF) with dual-scale roughness prepared by a micromolding phase separation ({$\mu$}PS) and electrostatic attraction. This membrane was used as a model for analysis of scaling behavior by calcium sulfate (CaSO4) scaling and fouling behavior by protein casein in comparison with commercial (C-PVDF) and micropillared (MP-PVDF) membranes. Unprece\- dented scaling/fouling resistance to CaSO4 and casein was observed in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) for SiNPs-MP-PVDF membrane. Similar scaling and fouling occurred for commercial PVDF and micropillared PVDF membranes. The observation corresponds well to the wetting state of all membranes as SiNPs-MP-PVDF shows suspended wetting, but MP-PVDF shows pinned wetting. From a hydrodynamic view, the suspended wetting attributes a slippery surface which reduces the direct contact of foulants to solid membrane part and leads to significantly reduced fouling and scaling. However, a pinned (or metastable) wetting state leads to a stagnant interfacial layer that is prone to severe fouling and scaling. This work highlights that both scaling and fouling resistance are indeed of suspended wetting state and slippage origin.},

However, because of the high concentration of salts and broad-spectrum foulants in wastewater, a huge challenge for ZLD is lack of a robust membrane-based desalination technology that enables direct wastewater recovery without costly pretreatment processes. Here, a paradigm-shift membrane distillation (MD) strategy is presented, wherein the traditional hydrophobic porous membrane is replaced with a hydrophilic nonporous charge-gradient hydrogel (CGH) membrane that possesses hypersaline tolerance, fouling/scaling-free properties, and negligible vapor transfer resistance inside the membrane, simultaneously. Therefore, the CGH-based MD with high water flux enables direct desalination of hypersaline wastewater (130~g~L               -1               ) containing broad-spectrum foulants (500~mg~L               -1               ) during continuous long-term operation (200 h), and this technology paves a promising way to direct ZLD for wastewater management.},

Under infrared radiation (peaked at 5.8--9.7 {$\mu$}m), the PRGA film can detect a temperature change of 0.2, 1.0, and 3.0 K of a target at 3, 25, and 54 cm distance. Even through a quartz window (transmissivity of {$\sim$}0.98 in the range of 2--4 {$\mu$}m), it can still successfully detect a temperature change of 0.6 and 5.8 K of a target at 3 and 28 cm distance. At room temperature, a laser power as low as 7.5 {$\mu$}W from a 405 nm laser and 5.9 {$\mu$}W from a 1550 nm laser can be detected. The detecting sensitivity to the 1550 nm laser is further increased by 3-fold when the sensor temperature was reduced from 295 K to 12 K. PRGA films are demonstrated to be a promising ultrasensitive bolometric detector, especially at low temperatures.},

  abstract = {In this study, we report on experiments designed to deconvolute the particle breakage kinetics and mechanism from the parallel phenomena (growth-dissolution, agglomeration) in attrition-enhanced deracemization processes. Through such experiments, we derived the specific breakage rates and cumulative breakage distribution functions for three grinding methods typically used in deracemization experiments: (a) bead grinding, (b) ultrasound grinding, and (c) the combination of bead and ultrasound grinding. Subsequently, we tested these methods on their ability to induce deracemization. We show that in the conventional bead grinding process, breakage occurs mostly by fracture. This results in slow deracemization rates due to the delayed formation of submicron particles that are essential to the process. Conversely, ultrasound grinding very efficiently breaks particles by abrasion. This leads to fast generation of an abundance of submicron fragments resulting in fast deracemization. However, using ultrasound, large crystals fracture rates are an order of magnitude lower than those using bead grinding, which results in an insufficient size decrease of the large counter enantiomer crystals and eventually to incomplete deracemization. Remarkably, the simultaneous application of bead and ultrasound grinding leads, due to synergistic effects of both fracture and abrasion, to 2-fold higher total deracemization rates compared to bead grinding alone. The present work offers new insights into the key role of particle breakage in attrition-enhanced deracemization, together with a basis for decoupling the individual phenomena involved in the process.},

  abstract = {Shake It to Wake It                            Viscoelastic materials combine the recoverable stretchiness found in elastic materials with the slow-flowing behavior of a thick fluid, like honey. When subjected to an oscillatory motion, the response will depend on the frequency. At low frequencies, the viscous behavior will dominate and lead to a dissipation of the applied energy as heat, while at fast frequencies the elastic behavior dominates.

The responsiveness of the material was probably caused by the ``zipping'' and ``unzipping'' of the nanotubes at points of contact.                        ,              A dense carbon-nanotube network shows nearly constant viscoelastic properties over an exceptionally wide temperature range.           ,              Viscoelasticity describes the ability of a material to possess both elasticity and viscosity. Viscoelastic materials, such as rubbers, possess a limited operational temperature range (for example, for silicone rubber it is --55{$^\circ$} to 300{$^\circ$}C), above which the material breaks down and below which the material undergoes a glass transition and hardens. We created a viscoelastic material composed from a random network of long interconnected carbon nanotubes that exhibited an operational temperature range from --196{$^\circ$} to 1000{$^\circ$}C. The storage and loss moduli, frequency stability, reversible deformation level, and fatigue resistance were invariant from --140{$^\circ$} to 600{$^\circ$}C. We interpret that the thermal stability stems from energy dissipation through the zipping and unzipping of carbon nanotubes at contacts.},

Being a very stable atomically thick membrane that can be suspended between two leads, graphene provides a perfect test platform for studying thermal conductivity in two-dimensional systems, which is of primary importance for phonon transport in low-dimensional materials. Here we report experimental measurements and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of thermal conduction in suspended single-layer graphene as a function of both temperature and sample length. Interestingly and in contrast to bulk materials, at 300\,K, thermal conductivity keeps increasing and remains logarithmically divergent with sample length even for sample lengths much larger than the average phonon mean free path. This result is a consequence of the two-dimensional nature of phonons in graphene, and provides fundamental understanding of thermal transport in two-dimensional materials.},

Therefore, in this review, we revisit the research of secondary nucleation in the past 30 years to understand the fundamentals and application of secondary nucleation. First, we summarize the sources of secondary nuclei, that is, how secondary nucleation occurs. Then, we discuss the secondary nucleation threshold from the perspective of the metastable zone widths which are associated with the nucleation mechanism. Furthermore, we discuss how to employ secondary nucleation to regulate the properties of crystalline products (particle size distribution, crystal polymorphism, chirality, etc.). More importantly, we also discuss how polymorphism and chirality can act as a probe to explore the origin of secondary nucleation. Finally, we give conclusions and outlooks, mainly on the molecular nucleation mechanism and crystal growth dead zone of the current topic of secondary nucleation.},

The uniform alignment of graphene sheets, inheriting the lamellar orders from GO liquid crystals, offers the porous fibers high specific tensile strength (188 kN m kg--1) and the porous cylinders high compression modulus (3.3 MPa). The porous graphene fibers have high specific surface area up to 884 m2 g--1 due to their interconnected pores and exhibit fine electrical conductivity (2.6 {\texttimes} 103 to 4.9 {\texttimes} 103 S m--1) in the wide temperature range of 5--300 K. The decreasing conductivity with decreasing temperature illustrates a typical semiconducting behavior, and the 3D interconnected network of 2D graphene sheets determines a dual 2D and 3D hopping conduction mechanism. The strong mechanical strength, high porosity, and fine electrical conductivity enable this novel material of ordered graphene aerogels to be greatly useful in versatile catalysts, supercapacitors, flexible batteries and cells, lightweight conductive fibers, and functional textiles.},

It is predicted that its room-temperature thermal conductivity is about 167 W/mK, which is much lower than that of graphene. With normal mode decomposition, the accumulated thermal conductivity with respect to phonon frequency and mean free path is analyzed. It is found that the acoustic phonons make a contribution of about 90\% to the thermal conductivity, and phonons with mean free paths larger than 100 nm make a contribution over 50\%. We demonstrate that the remarkably lower thermal conductivity of penta-graphene compared with graphene results from the lower phonon group velocities and fewer collective phonon excitations. Our study highlights the importance of structure-property relationship and provides better understanding of thermal transport property and valuable insight into thermal management of penta-graphene.},

The experimental results show that the PPy/GO composite electrode has a higher capacitance (186.67 F/g) and a lower charge transfer resistance (1.626 {\textohm}{$\cdot$} cm2) than the PPy electrode. The adsorption capacity of the PPy/GO composite electrode is 41.51 mg/g, which is about 2.67 times (15.52 mg/g) that of the PPy electrode. After five adsorption/desorption treatments, the adsorption capacity was maintained at about 98.0\%, and the regeneration rate was 94.7\%. Therefore, the electrode has good cycle stability and regenerability. In addition, the adsorption capacity of different metal ions follows the order Ag+ {$<$} Cd2+ {$<$} Cu2+ {$<$} Pb2+ {$<$} Fe3+, indicating that the PPy/GO composite electrode has stronger adsorption capacity for the added state, and the adsorption capacity for ions with the same valence state decreases with the increase in ion hydration radius.

In spontaneously precipitating supersaturated solutions, small concentrations of the additives caused a marked increase in the induction period preceding precipitation. Inhibition was mainly at the crystal-growth step by adsorption at the active-growth sites.

The precipitation process was studied in batch reactors at 25{$^\circ$}C and pH 8.50, under conditions of sustained supersaturation. Two of the organophosphorous compounds investigated, DDPE and BDBA, contained PCCP bonds in their molecules. In a third, BPDMI, the two PC bonds were separated by a bulky five-membered ring, and the other, DHHPA, contained only one PC bond. All organophosphorus compounds examined in the present work were synthesized in the laboratory and were found to be resistant to hydrolysis even at elevated temperatures, typical of those existing in geothermal wells. In all cases, the induction periods preceding the onset of the spontaneous precipitation of calcium carbonate were significantly increased depending on the concentration of the additives examined, while the concomitant precipitation rates were markedly slower at concentration levels as low as 2 {\texttimes} 10-8 mol dm-3. It is possible that the inhibiting effect of the organophosphorus compounds tested is due to the blocking of the active growth sites of the crystallites formed after the induction period. The existence of the PCCP bonds in the molecules of the organophosphorus compounds resulted in the most effective inhibitors, while the separation of the two phosphonyl groups by the bulky five-membered ring resulted in the same inhibitory activity as with the compound possessing only one phosphonyl group.},

  abstract = {Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) and air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) have emerged as potential technologies for water and wastewater treatment. This investigation developed a comprehensive two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model to describe and simulate heat transfer, mass transfer, and fluid flow in DCMD and AGMD processes. The effect of Reynolds number, inlet feed temperature, and distance between two successive~spacer filaments on the performance parameters such as mass flux, temperature polarisation, concentration polarisation, and thermal efficiency was investigated in this work. The feed and permeate side heat transfer coefficient increased with Re in the DCMD and AGMD models. The thickness of the velocity boundary layers reduced upon introducing spacers in the feed and permeate channels. The mass flux on the introduction of spacers increased in DCMD and AGMD models because the boundary layer resistance was reduced. The models with spacer showed a lower oncentration polarisation. DCMD model demonstrated a loweroncentration polarisation than the AGMD model as the former has higher mass flux than the latter leading to a higher solute concentration on the membrane surface. The thermal boundary layer was smaller in the spacer-filled channel because of the fluid mixing. In the AGMD model, the permeate side thermal boundary layer was unaffected because of the poor conductivity of air than water.},

  abstract = {Turbulent flow in oilfield pipes is very common, especially around chokes, tubing joints, and safety values. However the flow is generally laminar in laboratory tests for mineral scale formation and evaluation of scale inhibitors. The objective of this study is to investigate mineral scale formation and inhibition under laminar and turbulent conditions. A novel testing method of rotating cylinder apparatus has been developed to generate flow that spans from laminar to turbulent regimes (Reynolds number from 176 to 11,249) under field temperature of 70 {$^\circ$}C. Barite scale formation and inhibition by several typical inhibitors were investigated under different hydrodynamic conditions. Barite precipitation kinetics experiments showed no significant difference in precipitation kinetics between laminar and turbulent flow without scale inhibitors. However in the presence of scale inhibitors, precipitation kinetics was slower under turbulent condition. Barite precipitate was collected at the end of the experiment and examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). SEM images display major difference in barite size and morphology between different flow regimes - highly crystalline barite with an average size of 10 {\textmu}m in laminar flow and amorphous barite of much smaller size in turbulent flow. Adsorption kinetics experiments of scale inhibitors on barite shows faster kinetics in turbulent flow than that in laminar flow possibly due to enhanced mass transfer in turbulence. It is proposed that the slower barite precipitation kinetics with inhibitors in turbulent flow is due to enhanced adsorption of scale inhibitor on barite crystals, and the mechanisms of enhanced adsorption include larger specific surface area and faster mass transfer rate. These results indicate that scale inhibitors may be more effective under some turbulent conditions, as opposed to previous observations. The insights presented in this work will help to understand scale control in oilfield pipes especially under turbulent conditions, and develop optimal doses of scale inhibitors with regard to flow regimes.},

  abstract = {Simulation of multiphase flow in porous media is essential to manage the geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS) process, and physics-based simulation approaches usually take prohibitively high computational cost due to the nonlinearity of the coupled physics. This paper contributes to the development and evaluation of a deep learning workflow that accurately and efficiently predicts the temporal-spatial evolution of pressure and CO2 plumes during injection and post-injection periods of GCS operations. Based on a Fourier Neural Operator, the deep learning workflow takes input variables or features including rock properties, well operational controls and time steps, and predicts the state variables of pressure and CO2 saturation. To further improve the predictive fidelity, separate deep learning models are trained for CO2 injection and post-injection periods due to the difference in primary driving force of fluid flow and transport during these two phases. We also explore different combinations of features to predict the state variables. We use a realistic example of CO2 injection and storage in a 3D heterogeneous saline aquifer, and apply the deep learning workflow that is trained from physics-based simulation data and emulate the physics process. Through this numerical experiment, we demonstrate that using two separate deep learning models to distinguish post-injection from injection period generates the most accurate prediction of pressure, and a single deep learning model of the whole GCS process including the cumulative injection volume of CO2 as a deep learning feature, leads to the most accurate prediction of CO2 saturation. For the post-injection period, it is key to use cumulative CO2 injection volume to inform the deep learning models about the total carbon storage when predicting either pressure or saturation. The deep learning workflow not only provides high predictive fidelity across temporal and spatial scales, but also offers a speedup of 250 times compared to full physics reservoir simulation, and thus will be a significant predictive tool for engineers to manage the long-term process of GCS.},

Specifically, we employ latent variable models to construct probabilistic representations for the system states, and put forth an adversarial inference procedure for training them on data, while constraining their predictions to satisfy given physical laws expressed by partial differential equations. Such physics-informed constraints provide a regularization mechanism for effectively training deep generative models as surrogates of physical systems in which the cost of data acquisition is high, and training data-sets are typically small. This provides a flexible framework for characterizing uncertainty in the outputs of physical systems due to randomness in their inputs or noise in their observations that entirely bypasses the need for repeatedly sampling expensive experiments or numerical simulators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of examples involving uncertainty propagation in non-linear conservation laws, and the discovery of constitutive laws for flow through porous media directly from noisy data.

  abstract = {Materials combining lightweight, robust mechanical performances, and multifunctionality are highly desirable for engineering applications. Graphene aerogels have emerged as attractive candidates. Despite recent progresses, the bottleneck remains how to simultaneously achieve both strength and resilience. While multiscale architecture designs may offer a possible route, the difficulty lies in the lack of design guidelines and how to experimentally achieve the necessary structure control over multiple length scales. The latter is even more challenging when manufacturing scalability is taken into account. The Thalia dealbata stem is a naturally porous material that is lightweight, strong, and resilient, owing to its architecture with three-dimensional (3D) interconnected lamellar layers. Inspired by such, we assemble graphene oxide (GO) sheets into a similar architecture using a bidirectional freezing technique. Subsequent freeze-drying and thermal reduction results in graphene aerogels with highly tunable 3D architectures, consequently an unusual combination of strength and resilience. With their additional electrical conductivity, these graphene aerogels are potentially useful for mechanically switchable electronics. Beyond such, our study establishes bidirectional freezing as a general method to achieve multiscale architectural control in a scalable manner that can be extended to many other material systems.},

With only 5.3~wt\% of GNPs, the composite exhibits a high thermal conductivity of 1.35~W~m-1~K-1, 463\% higher than that of the composite without GNPs. The highly porous cellulose network and the low loading of highly thermally conductive GNPs are responsible for the high loading of PEG in the composite with a satisfactory latent heat of fusion of 156.1~J~g-1.},

The heat transport in the MD process was modeled to assess the membrane distillation coefficients (Bm). The experimentally determined Bm showed up to 50\% deviation from the modeled values for CF4 modified PVDF membranes. An effective evaporation factor, as a function of surface porosity and surface water contact angle, was proposed to correlate surface wettability contribution to the MD flux. This factor was fitted by comparing the experimentally determined flux with modeled one. It was found that the factor, which is positively related to surface water contact angle and surface porosity, varied with the membrane wettability and can rationally explain the deviation between observed and theoretical fluxes. In addition, CF4 plasma modification could increase the membrane׳s evaporation efficiency from 54.3\% for the virgin membrane up to 63.4\% for surface modified membranes because of the increase of the effective evaporation area factor. The introduction of the factor provides a means to evaluate the membrane surface hydrophobicity to the MD flux and necessitate the development of super even ultra-hydrophobic membranes.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is a thermally-driven membrane-based separation technique, which has shown great potential of use for molecular separation in different processes like wastewater treatment and desalination. This technology applies a microporous hydrophobic membrane (MHM) to remove dissolved molecules from a liquid flow. Despite brilliant advantages, use of MD process in industries has been restricted due to the non-existence of sufficient information about membrane types, modules specifications and techno-economic data at full scale. This paper aims to present a comprehensive overview of the advantages of MD process compared to other conventional membrane-based techniques and major operational challenges towards the application of this technique for industrial purposes. Fouling and wetting of membranes are noteworthy challenges, which may prevent the widespread use of the MD process in various industrial approaches such as wastewater treatment. Inappropriate management of both fouling and wetting can eventuate in membrane damage and as a result, decrement of separation efficiency. The prominent objective of this review is to interpret the transport phenomena, different fouling/wetting mechanisms and their suitable mitigation procedures in MD system accompanying with recommending promising strategies that may be beneficial in perceiving and minimizing the fouling/wetting problem.

The iron content in the nanofiber, measured by energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy, increased proportionally with the increase of the MOF concentration in the spinning dope, indicating a uniform distribution of MOF in the nanofiber. The water contact angle increased up to 138.06 {\textpm} 2.18{$^\circ$} upon the incorporation of 5 wt \% MOF, and a liquid entry pressure of 82.73 kPa could be maintained, making the membrane useful for direct contact membrane distillation experiments.

Furthermore, lowering polymerization temperature makes PPy films have smaller and more pores or vesicles. The PPy films prepared at 0 C with Tween80 as a surfactant possess a high specific capacitance of 261 F g21 at 25 mV s21 as well as retain 75\% of the initial specific capacitance value after 1000 cycles.

  abstract = {Highly compressible graphene-based monoliths with excellent mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties hold great potential as multifunctional structural materials to realize the targets of energy-efficiency, comfort, and safety for buildings, vehicles, aircrafts, etc. Unfortunately, the ultralow mechanical strength and limited macroscale have hampered their practical applications. Herein, ultrastrong superelastic graphene aerogel with infinite macroscale is obtained by a facile wet-press assembly strategy based on the novel superplastic air-dryable graphene hydrogel (SAGH). The SAGH with isotropic, open-cell, and highly porous microstructure is carefully designed by a dual-template sol--gel method. Countless SAGH ``bricks'' can be assembled together orderly by press to form the strongly combined wet-press assembled graphene aerogel (WAGA) ``wall'' after air-drying. The WAGA with highly oriented, dense, multiple-arch microstructure possesses arbitrary macroscale, outstanding compressive strength (47 MPa, over 10 times higher than the best ever reported), super elasticity ({$>$}97\% strain), and high conductivity (378 S m-1). The strong adhesion is attributed to the tightly face-to-face contacted graphene interfaces caused by wet-press and air-drying. The WAGAs prove to be excellent multifunctional structural materials in the fields of high pressure/strain sensor, tunable mechanical energy absorber, high-performance fire-resistance, and thermal insulation. This facile strategy is easily extended to fabricate other similar metamaterials.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is considered as a promising next-generation technology for desalination. However, there is no specific membrane designed and engineered for this application yet. Recently, electrospun polymeric membranes have been widely investigated due to their relatively high porosity, high hydrophobicity and controllable pore size. However, the robustness of such membranes is not guaranteed as they are susceptible to wetting in long-term operation. Heat-press treatment is a simple and effective procedure to improve both morphological and mechanical characteristics of the electrospun membrane. Nevertheless, the heat-press technique is not fully investigated although some conditions are applied to the electrospun membrane in previous researches. In this paper, a comprehensive investigation of the effect of heat-press temperature, pressure and duration on the morphological and mechanical characteristics of electrospun membrane is accomplished. Impressive improvement of mechanical strength and liquid entry pressure (LEP) can be achieved after heat-press treatment on the electrospun membranes. It is also found that temperature and duration play more important roles than pressure in heat-press treatment. In addition, it is ascertained that optimal treatment conditions for heat-press includes temperature at 150{$^\circ$}C, pressure at 6.5kPa, and duration for 8h for the present electrospun polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene membrane. A decent DCMD permeation flux of 29 LMH and salt rejection of 99.99\% can be achieved with the optimally heat-pressed electrospun membranes for desalination at feed and permeate temperatures of 60 and 20{$^\circ$}C, respectively.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is an alternative membrane technology that offers the capacity to treat highly saline water including industrial wastewater, seawater, brine water from other processes, and oil-gas field produced water. However, conventional hydrophobic membranes suffer fast wetting and severe fouling especially when low surface tension chemicals exist in saline water, which compromises the performance of MD. Recent advances in material science and nanomaterials research have led to the incorporation of special wetting properties on membrane surfaces. Membranes with special wettability can achieve high resistance against membrane fouling and wetting, as well as overcome the trade-off between membrane permeability and selectivity. This review summarizes the progress and recent development of studies on MD membranes with special wettability. Firstly, the fundamental concepts pertaining to membrane surface wettability including insights of their benefits and potential issues are highlighted in this review. Secondly, fabrication methods and applications of membranes utilizing various special wettability are discussed in detail, along with their challenges. Finally, this review concludes the advantages of membranes with special wettability and demonstrates potential solutions to the above-mentioned challenges for future research in high saline wastewater treatment.},

  abstract = {Membrane fouling, especially inorganic fouling due to salt crystal formation and deposition on the membrane surface, is still a major technical issue in membrane distillation (MD) applications. In this study, microbubble aeration (MBA) was included in a laboratory-scale vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) rig and its effect on a desalination process was examined. Without MBA, serious membrane scaling occurred during desalination of simulated high-salinity sea water (100 g.L{\`A}1 salt concentration), which resulted in a dramatic reduction of permeate flux to essentially zero after 120 min. Scanning electron microscopy showed that a layer of large cuboid salt crystals uniformly covered the membrane surface. However, membrane scaling was mitigated with the introduction of MBA, resulting in the improved VMD desalination performance, which was positively correlated with pump pressure in the microbubble (MB) generator. Results showed that the effective processing time of the VMD desalination processing cycle was respectively prolonged to 150, 180, and more than 300 and 360 min (cf. 120 min without MBA) when the pump pressure was respectively at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 MPa, leading to the increase of cumulative water production. Further studies found that larger numbers of MBs of smaller size were produced at higher pump pressure, which are more beneficial for increasing water vapor production and alleviating salt precipitation. The difference in zeta potential between the MBs in distilled water (about {\`A}30 mV) and that in SW100 solution (about -2 mV) demonstrated that MBA not only effectively mitigated the negative effect of concentration polarization by enhancing the surface shear rate at the membrane surface, but also reduced salt precipitation probably due to the MBs attracting counterions to the gas-water interface. Finally, energy consumption analysis of the modified VMD desalination process revealed that MBA, while itself only adding about 3\% to the total energy consumption at varied pump pressures, was able to improve the specific energy consumption, especially at higher pump pressures. Together, these results demonstrate that MBA is an effective way of improving the performance of VMD desalination of water.},

While maintaining the superhydrophobicity of the membrane, we have addressed the problem of bioaccumulation by immobilizing perfluoro-tert-butyl groups on the commercially-available aerogels. The resulting fluorous aerogels were electrosprayed on the top of commercial PVDF membranes to fabricate superhydrophobic membranes. The effects of varying the alkyl chain between the aerogel and the perfluoro-tert-butoxy groups and the concentration of the modified aerogel were studied to identify the optimal membrane for membrane distillation (MD). The fabricated membranes were tested for MD performance with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and saline water (3.5\% NaCl). The F1-SiG100 membrane (prepared by grafting 300 mg of 1-(nonafluoro-tert-butoxy)-4-butylethoxysilane aerogel on 300 mg of PVDF-HFP) exhibited superhydrophobicity (water contact angle = 151.2{$^\circ$}), a very rough surface (Ra = 2.17 {$\mu$}m), and an extremely low surface free energy (0.82 {\textpm} 0.17 mN m-1).

  abstract = {Mineral scaling is a major constraint that limits the performance of membrane distillation (MD) for hypersaline wastewater treatment. Although the use of antiscalants is a common industrial practice to mitigate mineral scaling, the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of antiscalants in inhibiting different mineral scaling types have not been systematically investigated. Herein, we perform a comparative investigation to elucidate the efficiencies of antiscalant candidates with varied functional groups for mitigating gypsum scaling and silica scaling in MD desalination. We show that antiscalants with Ca(II)-complexing moieties (e.g., carboxyl group) are the most effective to inhibit gypsum scaling formed via crystallization, whereas amino-enriched antiscalants possess the best performance to mitigate silica scaling created by polymerization. A set of microscopic and spectroscopic analyses reveal distinct mechanisms of antiscalants required for those two common types of scaling. The mitigating effect of antiscalants on gypsum scaling is attributed to the stabilization of scale precursors and nascent CaSO4 nuclei, which hinders phase transformation of amorphous CaSO4 toward crystalline gypsum. In contrast, antiscalants facilitate the polymerization of silicic acid, immobilizing active silica precursors and retarding the gelation of silica scale layer on the membrane surface. Our study, for the first time, demonstrates that antiscalants with different functionalities are required for the mitigation of gypsum scaling and silica scaling, providing mechanistic insights on the molecular design of antiscalants tailored to MD applications for the treatment of wastewaters containing different scaling types.},

  abstract = {The application of membrane distillation (MD) to hypersaline wastewater treatment is constrained by mineral scaling. Although tuning membrane surface wettability has been recently used to mitigate membrane scaling in MD, the effectiveness of this strategy for different scaling types has not been well understood. Furthermore, two important factors that determine the performance of MD membrane, namely wetting resistance and scaling reversibility, have been rarely discussed in MD scaling studies. In this work, we investigated the effects of membrane surface wettability on pore wetting and scaling reversibility associated with gypsum and silica scaling in MD. We challenged a hydrophobic membrane, a Janus membrane with a hydrophilic top layer, and a superhydrophobic membrane with gypsum- and silica-containing feed solutions. Compared to the hydrophobic and Janus membranes, the superhydrophobic membrane delayed scaling induction and enhanced scaling reversibility in gypsum scaling tests, in which the total water recoveries achieved by the tested membranes were inversely correlated to membrane surface hydrophilicity. Also, the superhydrophobic membrane uniquely resisted pore wetting induced by gypsum scaling, probably by preventing feedwater intrusion into membrane pores. In contrast, altering membrane surface wettability was ineffective to improve either scaling reversibility or total water recovery under silica scaling, which did not induce pore wetting for all the tested membranes. We attributed the differences in scaling behaviors as well as the varied responses to membrane surface wettability between gypsum and silica scaling to their distinct scaling mechanisms. The oriented and intrusive gypsum crystallization resulted in pore deformation and discrete crystals that could be detached by physical cleaning. In contrast, the slow kinetics and lack of orientation of silica polymerization formed a thin and crosslinked scaling layer, which was not intrusive but firmly attached to the membrane surface. The results of our study provide valuable insights on the interplays among membrane surface wettability, scaling type, and membrane performance in MD desalination, and suggest that the development of scaling mitigation strategies in MD should be tailored to the varied mechanisms of different scaling types.},

A four-step mechanism was proposed to elaborate the process.           ,              Membrane distillation (MD) has attracted great interest as a promising water purification technology suitable for the treatment of hypersaline wastewater, but its performance is constrained by mineral scaling at the membrane--water interface. Silica scaling is a common but unique type of scaling due to its amorphous nature, but its underlying mechanism has not been elucidated in the literature. In this study, we used a hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, a Janus PVDF membrane with hydrophilic coating, and a superhydrophobic PVDF membrane to investigate the mechanism of silica scaling in MD. The membranes were challenged with silica-containing feedwater with different saturation status. When silica was initially unsaturated, the water vapor flux of MD remained relatively stable, despite the formation of silica scale on the membrane surface. In contrast, a dramatic decline of water vapor flux occurred when the initial silica concentration was supersaturated. However, membrane surface wettability did not affect the starting time of the flux decline. The superhydrophobic membrane exhibited the slowest flux decline rate with time, while the Janus membrane displayed the best water productivity. In colloidal silica fouling that excluded heterogeneous nucleation, the superhydrophobic membrane was superior in both reducing the flux decline and extending water productivity. This difference, along with microscopic characterization of the scaling layer, provided explicit evidence that both homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation contribute to the flux decline caused by silica scaling. A four-step mechanism of silica scaling in MD is proposed, in which the decline of water vapor flux is initiated by homogenous nucleation in the bulk solution but facilitated by surface-mediated heterogeneous nucleation.},

A kind of 3D porous network microstructure can be directly created on polyamide-6 (PA6) substrate by a one-step femtosecond laser direct writing method. The preparation process of SLIPS mainly includes three steps: femtosecond laser ablation, fluoroalkyl layer modification, and infusion of lubricating liquid. The porous layer and the substrate layer of this as-prepared SLIPS are inherent one material. Such SLIPS has many advantages over the most reported SLIPS fabricated based on "deposition/coating" methods whose porous layers are foreign materials against the substrates. A broad range of liquids including water, hexadecane, lake water, ink, glycerol, coffee, milk, egg white, and egg yolk can easily slide down the 10 degrees tilted SLIPS, revealing that the resultant SLIPS has excellent liquid-repellent ability. Even though the SLIPS suffers from heavily physical damage, the surface can rapidly self-repair without any additional treatment and obtain slippery property again. The developed SLIPS promises to contribute to the achievement of omniphobic materials in self-cleaning, antifouling, biomedical devices, and fuel transport.},

  abstract = {Desalination is imperative to mitigate the global water scarcity as it produces drinking water from unpotable water. Currently, reverse osmosis membrane processes are widely used and account for 60\% of desalination plants globally as they have lower energy requirements than other techniques, such as thermal desalination. Another promising alternative to desalination is membrane distillation (MD), which has been highlighted as one of the most promising and cost-effective desalination technologies over the last five decades. MD is a thermally driven desalination process that uses microporous and hydrophobic membranes through which only vapor can pass. Because non-volatile ions cannot pass through the membrane, MD theoretically achieves 100\% salt rejection. In addition, MD is superior to other techniques as it is conducted at relatively low temperature and pressure, and is less sensitive to the feed concentration. MD is a desalination process that uses the vapor pressure difference between the feed and permeate as the driving force through the membranes. Over 2,800 scientific publications appeared in Web of Science as of September 2019 (over 400 just in 2019) describing the current state of development and potential future applications of MD. Although these publications provide excellent knowledge regarding MD, they are rather fragmented, and it is difficult to gain a complete overview of the basic principles and functions of membranes for MD configurations and their application to real plants. In this book, we introduce MD from the invention of this technique to the recent developments in membranes and processes. The membrane materials and configurations of MD processes are systematically discussed, along with an introduction to real pilot plants that have been installed and tested in the field, and an economic analysis of MD. The objective of this book is to provide a short, but reasonably comprehensive, introduction to MD to graduate students and persons with an engineering or natural science background, to gain a basic understanding of MD, and the associated materials, configurations, and applications, without studying a large number of different reference books.},

  abstract = {Omniphobic coatings which can efficiently diminish the interfacial reactions between the underlying substrates and foreign liquids present broad technological impacts and enormous potential applications, whereas the current prepared superamphiphobic surfaces are constrained to their weak robustness owing to the vulnerability of the sophisticated hierarchical structures. Herein, we employed oxidative polymerization method to graft polyaniline (PANI) nanofibers on arbitrarily shaped surfaces that further modified with perfluo-roalkylthiol and infiltrated with perfluoropolyether lubricant, constructing a slippery lubricant-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS). With the enlargement of the polymerization time, the coverage degree of PANI coating on the glass surface gradually increased and their transmittance reduced simultaneously. Meanwhile, the influences of the structure geometry and surface chemistry on the slippery behavior of foreign liquids on the SLIPS were investigated, further verifying that the synergetic effect of the adequate texture roughness and matched surface chemistry is the prerequisite for preparing steady and defect-free lubricant layer. Moreover, the prepared SLIPS could be applied in various promising applications such as anti-fogging, anti-fingerprint, three-dimensional droplet manipulation and crude-oil lossless transportation. More importantly, the lubricant layer remained stable on the surfaces after long-term storage in high/low temperature, water immersion and ultraviolet irradiation, and displayed superior mechanical resistance to water impact, sandpaper abrasions and knife scratches. Therefore, this strategy for fabricating nepenthes-inspired lubricant-infused surfaces is expected to further promote the cognition and manufacture of multifunctional omniphobic materials.},

  abstract = {A shortage of safe drinking water is one of the leading problems in the world. Even in developed countries where water treatment systems are present, safe drinking water may not be always available due to the limitations of advanced water treatment techniques and high energy costs. On the other hand, many rural communities in Asia and Africa situated in semi-arid to arid regions are without reliable access to clean drinking water. It is, therefore, important to explore how solar energy can be linked to water treatment systems for clean drinking water production. Membrane-based water purification technologies play a major role in water purification by utilization of low-cost heat sources to make the process economically and technically viable for small, medium, and large-scale applications. Solar energy can be a viable source of power for water purification facilities in the coming years. Photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors are appropriate solar energy collectors for making a solar-powered water treatment system. Solar-assisted membrane-based water purification techniques could have a viable solution to the existing problems in semi-arid and arid regions. Due to the high quality of potable water demand, studies have been carried out on solar-assisted membrane-based technologies in water purification. This review considers basic concepts, specific energy consumption, water production cost, and applications of solar-driven membrane-based water purification technologies such as reverse osmosis, forward osmosis, electrodialysis, membrane distillation, and hybrid membrane systems. This review will allow the researchers to have a wider overview of the effort made by several investigators in the area of solar-assisted membrane-based water purification technology.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have now been broadly applied to investigate membrane transport and optimize membrane design, but mostly for nanostructures without the involvement of phase change due to the enormous computational time and spatial scale requirements. In the present study, a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model is developed to overcome the limitations in simulating membrane distillation through meso-size (2--5 nm) channels formed by graphene bilayer at the direct contact mode. The new coarse-grained approach enables the comprehensive evaluation of the influences of channel opening, hydrostatic pressure, and temperature. In addition, the evaporation processes at the membrane surface as well as the water vapour transport can now be analysed in a statistically reliable manner. The coarse-grained results show that the permeate flux through the graphene bilayer channels is almost three-order-of-magnitude higher than the commonly used microporous polymer membranes nowadays, which demonstrate the significant application potential. Increasing the hydrostatic pressure is found to be uneconomical due to its limited effects. The enhanced evaporation at small channel opening is due to the elevated collisions among the interface water molecules. Most importantly, the permeate flux shows a non-monotonic dependence on the channel opening. The flux is highest when the channel opening is 2 nm, after which the dominant transport of water molecules inside the channel transit from surface diffusion to activated Knudsen transport. This finding has an important implication towards the design of graphene bilayer membranes for membrane distillation in the future.},

Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) and nanofiltration (NF) were selected to study calcium scaling impact on thermal and pressure driven membrane processes. Calcium sulfate (CaSO4) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) solutions with salinity in the range from 3000 to 30,000\,mg/L were used as the feed. All DCMD and NF tests were performed at identical feed temperature (i.e., 40\,{$^\circ$}C) and shear conditions (i.e., Re\,=\,771\,{\textpm}\,28). The average size of CaSO4 and CaCO3 crystals formed in the DCMD system was larger and the scale was more porous than in the NF system. The permeate flux in NF system was impacted by both calcium scales regardless of the feed salinity, while only CaSO4 scale formed at low salinity affected the performance of DCMD system. Surface crystallization in NF systems is likely extended into the membrane pores, which lead to permanent reduction in membrane permeability. This study demonstrated that the impact of calcium scaling is affected by both feed salinity and separation driving force, and is much less severe in thermal than pressure driven membrane processes.},

There have been numerous publications on water freezing; however, confusion regarding the process of freezing remains. In this review, we mainly focused on the nucleation aspects of water freezing; in particular, we focused on the effect of the surface morphology and nanostructure of foreign bodies. This review covers the recent progress in ice nucleation and anti-freezing strategies within the framework of nucleation principles. In this regard, we first summarize the crystal nucleation theories. Due to high interfacial energy, ice crystallization is primarily controlled by heterogeneous nucleation events, because the homogeneous nucleation barrier of ice is extremely high. In addition to the interfacial energy, the interfacial morphology or nanostructure of foreign bodies plays a diverse role under different supercooling regimes due to the Gibbs--Thomson effect. This effect gives rise to the inverse homogeneous-like nucleation phenomenon, in which foreign bodies have little influence on the nucleation barrier. This ensures the accurate measurement of the nucleation barrier, critical size, and water--ice interfacial energy, in agreement with the latest studies based on a microemulsions approach, metadynamics, the mW model,               etc.               As a consequence, anti-freezing strategies can be implemented by reducing the nucleation rate through restriction of the contact area of the water/substrate interface, by increasing the heterogeneous nucleation barrier through modification of the interfacial properties of foreign particles, including the interfacial structure and the interaction between the water and foreign particles and by kink kinetics. Within this context, the anti-freezing mechanism of superhydrophobic substrates was reviewed. Therefore, it follows that by significantly reducing the contact area between the water and substrate, superhydrophobic materials can effectively reduce the heterogeneous nucleation rate. We hope that this review will provide a unified picture and guidance for future work on water freezing.},

  abstract = {In membrane distillation (MD), mass and heat transfer occurs simultaneously through the membrane. According to the theory for mass and heat balance, if the membrane is compressible, total pressure in the pore and the thermal resistance of the membrane will change and affect the performance of the membrane. To verify this theory, direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) experiments were conducted in which the absolute pressures applied on both sides of membranes were controlled identically and varied independently of the flowrates. Both hollow fibre and flat-sheet membrane modules were employed. The hollow fibre membrane had a rigid structure that was not deformable over the range of experimental pressures (1--50kPa), while the composite flat-sheet membrane was composed of a scrim support layer and a sponge-like PTFE active layer that was compressible over the range of pressures considered. When pressures were applied on both sides of the compressible membrane, the volume of active layer will become smaller. As the active layer was compressed in the tested pressure range, the void volume (porosity) and the thickness of the active layer was reduced, which resulted in the reduction of the thermal resistance of the membrane and so increased the heat conduction loss across the membrane. Furthermore, if there is no air escaping out of the membrane pores, the air pressure within the pores will increase due to the reduction of void volume (porosity), leading to an increase of the mass transfer resistance. The effect of pressure on the flux was also considered at different velocities (0.095 and 0.114m/s) and temperatures (50 and 70{$^\circ$}C). For the composite flat-sheet membrane, there was a 15--39\% flux reduction when the gauge pressure was increased from 1 to 45kPa at constant inlet temperatures and flowrates. However, there was no noticeable change of flux with pressure for the incompressible hollow fibre module.},

Often, such equipment is condemned to surplus and destroyed. End-of-life plans that retain some of the material and energy used to create scientific instruments are of interest, just as in other manufacturing sectors. This is especially true when an instrument can be given new capabilities beyond those for which it was originally designed, maybe even surpassing newly built models. We report the ``upcycling'' of a Wyatt multiangle, multidetector instrument designed for static light scattering (SLS). The instrument retains SLS capability but was extended to multiangle, multidetector, multicorrelator dynamic light scattering operation by adding readily available fiber optics, detectors, and a modern, multichannel autocorrelator. Because one of the main catalysts of obsolescence is software compatibility, data processing was implemented with the stable Microsoft Excel platform, including a graphical user interface. Instrument performance is demonstrated with microemulsions, protein and polymer solutions, suspensions of latex particles, and suspensions of cellulose nanocrystals.},

Such 3D GSs were fabricated by a modified hydrothermal method and a unidirectional freeze-casting process with hierarchical porous microstructures. Because of high porosity (99.9\%), significant phonon scattering, and strong {$\pi$}--{$\pi$} interaction at the interface barriers of multilayer graphene cellular walls, the GSs demonstrate a sequence of multifunctional properties simultaneously, such as lightweight density, thermal insulating characteristics, and outstanding mechanical robustness. At 100 {$^\circ$}C, oxidized GSs exhibit a thermal conductivity of 0.0126 {\textpm} 0.0010 W/(m K) in vacuum. The thermal conductivity of oxidized GSs remains relatively unaffected despite large-scale deformation-induced densification of the microstructures, as compared to the behavior of reduced GSs (rGSs) whose thermal conductivity increases dramatically under compression. The contrasting behavior of oxidized GSs and rGSs appears to derive from large differences in the intersheet contact resistance and varying intrinsic thermal conductivity between reduced and oxidized graphene sheets. The oxidized GSs also exhibit excellent flame retardant behavior and mechanical robustness, with only 2\% strength decay after flame treatment. In a broader context, this work demonstrates a useful strategy to design porous nanomaterials with a tunable heat conduction behavior through interface engineering at the nanoscale.},

  abstract = {Water shortage is a serious, long-standing global issue that urgently needs to be solved. Recently, various kinds of techniques have been developed for the treatment of wastewater. Among them, solar thermal conversion of steam generation is a green and sustainable approach for regeneration of clean water. Herein, we develop the solar steam generator based on the defect-abundant graphene sheets for highly efficient production of clean water with high rejection of ions, organic media, and bacteria. The thermal conductivity of defect-abundant graphene aerogel is as low as 0.0075\,W\,m-1 K-1 with a record surface temperature of up to ca 90\,{$^\circ$}C under only 1\,sun, which thus promotes a high water evaporation rate of 1.78\,kg\,m-2 h-1. Efficient production of clean water with high rejection of ions, oil and bacteria is demonstrated, which proved the possibility for a one-step production of drinkable water from the water sources of the sea, lake, and emulsified oil/water mixtures.},

  abstract = {Owing to the unique thermal transfer property, graphene attracts great attention as heat dissipation material. Many works have been devoted to increase thermal conductivity of graphene filled polymer composite by increasing the graphene loading. In this work, a novel composite was fabricated by rolling graphene sheets into vertically aligned graphene film (VAGF) and then penetrating liquid polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) into it. The thermal conductivity of the VAGF/PDMS composite is up to 614.85 Wm{\`A}1 K{\`A}1, i.e. an enhancement per wt\% of as high as 3329\% compared to pure PDMS. This enhancement is due to the vertical alignment of graphene films with high in-plane thermal conductivity, which form a rapid and effective heat-transfer path. The heat dissipation performance of VAGF/PDMS composite is further confirmed by infrared thermal imaging technology. The temperature of the VAGF/ PDMS composite rises fastest under the same heating condition, compared with PDMS and copper. The results prove that the VAGF/PDMS composite most likely becomes a good candidate of high performance thermal interfacial materials.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) that can sustainably recover freshwater until salt crystallization is a potential candidate for hypersaline wastewater treatment. However, a huge challenge for MD is membrane scaling, which sharply decreases membrane flux and salts rejection efficiency. This study reported an ion-nucleating competition cooperated with commercial antiscalants to mitigate membrane scaling. Results showed that the superhydrophobic PVDF (SH-PVDF) membrane could effectively delay the gypsum nucleation on the slippery membrane surface owing to the increased membrane surface roughness, but scaling inevitably occurs on the membrane surface in the supersaturated condition. Introducing the foreign ions such as one-component Na+ or Mg2+ and two-component Na+/Mg2+ mixture can improve the gypsum solubility and delay gypsum nucleation for mitigating membrane scaling. Besides, the synergistic combination of commercial antiscalant and ion-nucleating competition is extraordinarily effective in retarding membrane scaling and preventing membrane pore wetting, achieving a high-water recovery of {\textasciitilde}85~\% and robust salt rejection of {\textasciitilde}100~\%. The mechanisms of ion-nucleating competition cooperated with antiscalants were also discussed with the help of characterizations. This work provided a novel ion-nucleating competition in collaboration with antiscalants for hypersaline wastewater management, which is important for MD to be applied in near-zero liquid discharge (ZLD).},

Measuring the gas permeability as a function of membrane length and extrapolating to zero length provided enough membrane material information for modelling the flux. These values resulted in the predicted Vacuum Membrane Distillation (VMD) flux within the experimental errors (7 5\%) for different velocities. The predicted results at different temperatures were mostly within the experimental variation range. However, the error (o 10\%) was greater at the highest temperature tested, perhaps due to water evaporation in the feed tank. Additionally both the modelling and experimental results show that the flux in VMD was independent of the module packing density under the presented conditions. The results also show that the mathematical model predictions agree well with the experimental results of short experimental duration (1--2 h).},

Results from sonication experiments and positron annihilation spectroscopy confirmed that EDA cross-linking not only enhanced structural stability but also enlarged the nanochannels among the laminated GO nanosheets for higher water permeability. HPEI 60K was found to be the most effective post-treatment agent that resulted in GO framework membranes with a higher surface charge and lower transport resistance. The newly developed membrane exhibited a high pure water permeability of 5.01 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 and comparably high rejections toward Mg2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+. These results have demonstrated the great potential of GO framework materials in wastewater treatment and may provide insights for the design and fabrication of the next generation two-dimensional (2D)-based NF membranes.},

The as-prepared NWFs had great oil absorption capacities and possessed high oil-water separation efficiency.

A critical review is conducted in this paper, to identify the most potential space energy resources, to conclude on the current exploitation technologies and to suggest on the challenges and future directions. Space solar power station, also known as SSPS, is presented first as a well-known utilization of space energy, and we go through the international progress, evolution of the collection systems and the thermophotovoltaic systems. The main technical gaps hampering the practical application of SSPS is concluded then to inspire future investigations. Energy on Mars is presented afterwards as a representative ISRU(In Situ Resource Utilization)-type energy resource, and we select three potential resources on Mars worth exploitation: solar energy, geothermal energy and wind energy. A model describing the global solar irradiance on Mars is concluded, typical applications of geothermal energy is analyzed, the phase equilibrium of geothermal fluids is established and the wind turbine is designed. Furthermore, the review on energy on Moon is started with the discussion on lunar geology relevant with energy resources, and an example of feature detection using Convolutional Neural Networks is illustrated as an example to demonstrate the application of deep learning techniques in space energy exploitation. Solar energy is always taken into account in space activities, and we are more focusing on the discussion of Helium-3, a promising resource for nuclear fusion.

A number of stochastic reconstructions are essential to discover the geometry and topology of the porous media and the its flow behavior. While several deep-learning based generative models have been proposed to deal with the issue, the obstacles about stable training and difficulty in convergence limit the application of these models. To address these problems, a hybrid deep generative model for 3D porous media reconstruction is proposed. The hybrid model is composed of a variant autoencoder (VAE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN). It receives a two-dimensional image as input and generates 3D porous media. The encoder from VAE characterizes the statistical and morphological information of input image and generates a low-dimensional feature vector for generator. Benefiting from the hybrid model, the training becomes more stable and the generative capability is enhanced as well. Furthermore, a simple but useful loss function is used to help improve accuracy. The proposed model is tested on both isotropic and anisotropic porous media. The results show the synthetic realizations have good agreement to the targets on visual inspection, statistical functions and two-phase flow simulation.},

The structure of absorbers and salt resistance are two crucial parameters for water transport and desalination stability. Here, we designed a vertically aligned Janus MXene aerogel (VA-MXA) with hydrophobic upper layer and hydrophilic bottom layer. Compared with irregular porous channels, such regulatable and well-ordered vertical array structure gives competitive advantage in the capillary water transport, light absorption, and vapor escape. MXene, which possesses a theoretical light-to-heat conversion efficiency of 100\%, combined with the Janus structure, can efficiently convert light to heat and prevent the photothermal layer from ``direct bulk water contact'' with the hydrophobic upper layer, thus decreasing heat loss, while the hydrophilic bottom layer submerged in water can quickly pump water upward through the vertically aligned channels with low transport resistance and, meanwhile, enable effective inhibition of salt crystallization due to rapid dissolution with continuously pumping water. With a vertically aligned and Janus structure by flexible design, the Janus VA-MXA exhibited a high conversion efficiency (87\%) and stable water yield for 15 days ({$\sim$}1.46 kg{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}h-1) under 1 sun.

Recently, 1D polymer nanofibers have been widely researched as building blocks to develop a new species of 3D fibrous aerogels with a physically entangled and/or chemically crosslinked fibrous network. 3D fibrous aerogels not only hold intrinsic aerogel properties such as an open-cell pore structure, low density, high specific surface area, and large porosity, but also benefit from the inherent features of polymer nanofibers including excellent mechanical flexibility and toughness, a wide range of material selection, and additional functionality. In this review, recent research progress in the fabrication and application of 3D fibrous aerogels is systematically summarized. Relevant strategies for constructing 3D fibrous aerogels, including electrospinning, solution blow spinning, freeze-drying, thermally induced self-agglomeration, and carbonization, are presented. Typical applications in energy (e.g., pressure sensors, triboelectric nanogenerators, electromagnetic interference shielding, etc.) and the environment (e.g., air filtration, thermal insulation, interfacial solar vapor generation, etc.) are highlighted.

  abstract = {Scale formation presents an enormous cost to the global economy. Classical nucleation theory dictates that to reduce the heterogeneous nucleation of scale, the surface should have low surface energy and be as smooth as possible. Past approaches have focused on lowering surface energy via the use of hydrophobic coatings and have created atomically smooth interfaces to eliminate nucleation sites, or both, via the infusion of low-surface-energy lubricants into rough superhydrophobic substrates. Although lubricant-based surfaces are promising candidates for antiscaling, lubricant drainage inhibits their utilization. Here, we develop methodologies to deposit slippery omniphobic covalently attached liquids (SOCAL) on arbitrary substrates. Similar to lubricant-based surfaces, SOCAL has ultralow roughness and surface energy, enabling low nucleation rates and eliminating the need to replenish the lubricant. To enable SOCAL coating on metals, we investigated the surface chemistry required to ensure high-quality functionalization as measured by ultralow contact angle hysteresis ({$<$}3 degrees). Using a multilayer deposition approach, we first electrophoretically deposit (EPD) silicon dioxide (SiO2) as an intermediate layer between the metallic substrate and SOCAL. The necessity of EPD SiO2 is to smooth ({$<$}10 nm roughness) as well as to enable the proper surface chemistry for SOCAL bonding. To characterize antiscaling performance, we utilized calcium sulfate (CaSO4) scale tests, showing a 20X reduction in scale deposition rate than untreated metallic substrates. Descaling tests revealed that SOCAL dramatically decreases scale adhesion, resulting in rapid removal of scale buildup. Our work not only demonstrates a robust methodology for depositing antiscaling SOCAL coatings on metals but also develops design guidelines for the creation of antifouling coatings for alternate applications such as biofouling and high-temperature coking.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional graphene-based aerogels have promising applications in oil adsorption and environmental restoration. However, current research of graphene-based aerogels is often hindered by high preparation cost, poor mechanical properties and low recycling efficiency. Here, superelastic graphene aerogel (SGA) was prepared through one-step freezing and twice hydrothermal reduction followed by drying under ambient pressure. The simple atmospheric drying provides a possibility for large-scale preparation of high performance graphene-based aerogels. The prepared SGA not only has the ability of highly repeatable compression rebound, but also exhibits excellent oil adsorption performance. And the overall performance of SGA is better than most of graphenebased aerogels prepared by freeze drying. After the SGA was cyclically compressed with 70\% strain for 300 times, it can return to the original shape and height substantially. SGA retained about 90\% of the initial adsorption capacity after 50 cycles of adsorption and compression regeneration for cyclohexane.},

  abstract = {Pressure-retarded membrane distillation (PRMD) can convert low-grade heat to useful work by harvesting the pressure energy of the condensation liquid on the cold side. In this study, a new type of PRMD system for combined freshwater and power production was proposed. For this configuration, the thermal energy of the phase change is transported to the interface mainly by conduction rather than convection, which significantly reduces the pump power loss of the liquid flow. In addition, it also utilizes a multistage structure to regenerate heat with low pump power loss. The experimental results showed that, for a module with a heating area of 1.0 m2, this system can produce 188 L of freshwater and 27.8 kJ of power each day when operating between 80{$^\circ$}C and 40{$^\circ$}C. The water and power densities of the PRMD configuration would be affected by saline ions in the feed liquid, air resistance in the evaporation chamber, membrane wetting, and membrane compaction. The experimental and molecular dynamics simulation results indicated that a higher temperature difference or working temperature will significantly improve the desalination and power generation rates because of the increased mass transfer driving force of the vapor gradient. This study proved that it is possible for a PRMD system to simultaneously obtain net power and freshwater using low-grade heat as the only energy input. Nevertheless, the liquid supply, working pressure, and membrane properties should be improved to achieve better performance.},

This study aimed to synthesize a polyethyleneimine (PEI)-modified and AgNP-decorated GO nanocomposite (GO-PEI-Ag) through a facile approach through microwave irradiation without any extra reductants and surfactants; its antimicrobial activity was investigated on Gram-negative/positive bacteria (including drug-resistant bacteria) and fungi. Compared with GO-Ag, GO-PEI-Ag acquired excellent stability in physiological solutions and electropositivity, showing substantially higher antimicrobial efficacy. Moreover, GO-PEI-Ag exhibited particularly excellent long-term effects, presenting no obvious decline in antimicrobial activity after 1 week storage in physiological saline and repeated use for three times and the lasting inhibition of bacterial growth in nutrient-rich culture medium. In contrast, GO-Ag exhibited a {$>$}60\% decline in antimicrobial activity after storage. Importantly, GO-PEI-Ag effectively eliminated adhered bacteria, thereby preventing biofilm formation. The primary antimicrobial mechanisms of GO- PEI-Ag were evidenced as physical damage to the pathogen structure, causing cytoplasmic leakage. Hence, stable GO-PEI-Ag with robust, long-term antimicrobial activity holds promise in combating public-health threats posed by drug-resistant bacteria and biofilms.},

Importantly, the humidity sensor is demonstrated to be portable and compatible for applications in respiration assessment, noncontact monitoring and intelligent alarm. More importantly, by simply integrating the Nb2CTx/SA film-based sensor/nanogenerator with a capacitor and light-emitting diode (LED), a prototype of self-powered sensing system capable of indicating different relative humidity (i.e., low, medium or high) through the LED's brightness without external power supplies is demonstrated. This work not only demonstrates the design and fabrication of a smart self-powered humidity sensing system, but also opens a new avenue for development of next-generation intelligent wearable electronics.},

  abstract = {Fouling and accretion have negative impacts on a plethora of processes. To mitigate heterogeneous nucleation of a foulant, lowering the surface energy and reducing surface roughness are desired. Here, we develop a multilayer coating to mitigate solution-based heterogeneous fouling for internal flows. The first layer is a sol-gel silicon dioxide (SiO2) coating, which acts as a corrosion barrier, creates the surface chemistry needed for covalent bonding of the slippery omniphobic covalently attached liquid (SOCAL), and ensures an atomically smooth ({$<$}1 nm) interface. The second layer bonded to SiO2 is SOCAL, which further reduces the nucleation rate due to its low surface energy ({$<$}12 mJ/m(2)). The presence of a consistent solgel SiO2 base coating to bind to the SOCAL enables application to various metallic substrates. The coating is solid, making it more durable when compared to alternative slippery liquid-infused surfaces (LIS) that suffer from lubricant loss. To demonstrate performance and scalability, we apply our coating to the internal walls of aluminum (Al) tubing and test its fouling performance in a flow-fouling setup with single-phase flow of synthetic seawater. The seawater consists of saturated calcium sulfide (CaSO4), and fouling is characterized in both laminar and turbulent flow regimes (Reynolds numbers 1030 to 9300). Our coating demonstrated a reduction in salt scale fouling by 95\% when compared to uncoated Al tubes. Furthermore, we show our coating to withstand turbulent flow conditions, mechanical abrasion loading, and corrosive environments for durations much longer than LIS. Our work demonstrates a coating methodology applicable to a variety of metal substrates and internal passages to achieve antifouling in single-phase flows.},

To achieve high removal efficiency of both anionic and cationic pollutants and overcome recycling difficulty of GO, positively charged poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) was associated with GO to fabricate GO/ PEI (GP) 3D aerogels. Surface charges of the constructed GP aerogels were tuned from positive to negative within a wide range via changing solution pH. The constructed GP aerogels were stable in acidic and basic aqueous environments, and even in organic solvents (such as methanol, acetonitrile, methylbenzene, acetone and N,Ndimethyl formamide), which are easily recovered. Anionic methyl orange (MO) and cationic methylene blue (MB) were utilized as model pollutants to investigate the adsorption capability of the GP aerogels. The GP aerogels showed high adsorption capacity for anionic MO (331.0 mg/g) at pH 2.0 while for cationic MB (249.6 mg/g) at pH 10.5. The electrostatic attraction force and {$\pi$}-{$\pi$} interaction dramatically improved the adsorption capacity of the charge-tunable GP aerogels against both anionic and cationic dyes. In addition, the GP aerogels were able to selectively separate anionic and cationic dyes in designed aqueous environments.

  abstract = {Hydrophobic membranes suffer from wetting and scaling when treating hypersaline brine using membrane distillation (MD). Thus omniphobic membranes with re-entrant surfaces have been developed by diverse mod\- ifications to enhance anti-wetting/scaling properties. However, those post-modifications usually sacrifice membrane permeability in spite of improved stability. In this work, omniphobic membranes were fabricated by decorating polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibrous membranes with different silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) followed by fluorination. Compared to unmodified nanofibrous and commercial PVDF membranes, both smaller SiNPs coated membrane \#P-Min and larger SiNPs coated membrane \#P-Max can perfectly sustain liquids with low surface tensions on their surfaces without wetting. In contrast to \#P-Max with an oil contact angle of 136 {\textpm} 1{\textopenbullet}, \#P-Min exhibited better oleophobicity with an oil contact angle of 152 {\textpm} 1{\textopenbullet}. In addition, the rigidity of their omniphobic properties was confirmed by testing in harsh conditions. Moreover, \#P-Min successfully overcame the trade-off relation between membrane permeability and rejection with an enhanced MD flux due to more effective water evaporation area on membrane surface and a higher membrane porosity. While \#P-Max was wetted by a hypersaline feed solution composed of 25 wt\% NaCl, \#P-Min could maintain a stable flux of 15 L m- 2h- 1 in a continuous 7-h MD operation, which proved its excellent performance for brine treatment. Furthermore, \#P-Min exhibited less scaling tendency when feed was a saturated gypsum solution. Compared to \#P-Max, the better anti-scaling properties of \#P-Min should be due to its higher surface energy barrier, better slippery property and less solid-liquid contact area, which effectively impede crystal nucleation and attachment.},

In this work, a novel hierarchically-structured superhydrophobic membrane was prepared by grafting octavinyl-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (OVPOSS) onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane via UV-induced thiol-ene click reaction after the hydroxylation and sulfhydrylation pretreatment. The POSS/PVDF membrane exhibited high roughness and superhydrophobicity, and the pore structure was optimized with smaller size but centralized distribution. For the fabricated superhydrophobic membrane with low sliding angle (about 7.5{$^\circ$}), the maintaining of Cassie-Baxter state and the ``slip effect'' significantly mitigated membrane fouling and wetting, due to the retardation of the liquid invasion into the gas-solid interface. It was found that scaling was the leading fouling for the commercial PVDF membrane, and the interaction between Ca2+ and carboxyl was the main organic fouling mechanism. While for the POSS/PVDF membrane, organic fouling via hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction was the main membrane fouling and the scaling was significantly alleviated. The fabricated POSS/PVDF composite membrane had significant superiority over commercial PVDF membrane, which showed promising potential in challenging wastewater treatment.

  abstract = {Mechanical properties and structural integrity of 3D graphene aerogels are studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The influences of various simulation parameters are systematically discussed.           ,                             Graphene aerogel (GA), a 3D carbon-based nanostructure built on 2D graphene sheets, is well known for being the lightest solid material ever synthesized. It also possesses many other exceptional properties, such as high specific surface area and large liquid absorption capacity, thanks to its ultra-high porosity. Computationally, the mechanical properties of GA have been studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which uncover nanoscale mechanisms beyond experimental observations. However, studies on how GA structures and properties evolve in response to simulation parameter changes, which provide valuable insights to experimentalists, have been lacking. In addition, the differences between the calculated properties               via               simulations and experimental measurements have rarely been discussed. To address the shortcomings mentioned above, in this study, we systematically study various mechanical properties and the structural integrity of GA as a function of a wide range of simulation parameters. Results show that during the               in silico               GA preparation, smaller and less spherical inclusions (mimicking the effect of water clusters in experiments) are conducive to strength and stiffness but may lead to brittleness. Additionally, it is revealed that a structurally valid GA in the MD simulation requires the number of bonds per atom to be at least 1.40, otherwise the GA building blocks are not fully interconnected. Finally, our calculation results are compared with experiments to showcase both the power and the limitations of the simulation technique.

However, these three-dimensional microarchitectures are significantly limited by their scalability. Efforts have only been successful only in demonstrating overall structure sizes of hundreds of micrometres, or contain size-scale gaps of several orders of magnitude. This results in degraded mechanical properties at the macroscale. Here we demonstrate hierarchical metamaterials with disparate three-dimensional features spanning seven orders of magnitude, from nanometres to centimetres. At the macroscale they achieve high tensile elasticity ({$>$}20\%) not found in their brittle-like metallic constituents, and a near-constant specific strength. Creation of these materials is enabled by a high-resolution, large-area additive manufacturing technique with scalability not achievable by two-photon polymerization or traditional stereolithography. With overall part sizes approaching tens of centimetres, these unique nanostructured metamaterials might find use in a broad array of applications.},

  abstract = {Thermally driven membrane distillation process, for desalination of a wide spectrum of water, has attracted both scientific and industrial attention for decades. However, membrane fouling by contaminants in the feed stream was of great concern. Mitigating membrane fouling requires insights from surface and material science. We reported an omniphobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane with hierarchical structure which was created by spray coating of the nano/microspheres onto a commercial PVDF porous substrate. The multiscale microspheres were prepared based on electrostatic interactions between silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and polystyrene (PS) microsphere. A chemical binding agent, polymer 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (PA174) synthesized via free radical polymerization, was utilized to enhance the adhesion of the particles to the membrane support, leading to a robust structure. The final fluorination step using 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecyltrimethoxysilane (17-FAS) attributed the membrane omniphobicity. The water/hexadecane contact angle of the present membrane surface was 176{$^\circ$}/138.4{$^\circ$}, and the water sliding angle was 7{$^\circ$}. Challenged with a hexadecane emulsion feed solution stabilized with the SDS surfactant in membrane distillation, the membrane showed a very stable flux and decrease in conductivity on the permeate side in contrast to decreased flux and increase in permeate conductivity for other benchmark membranes. This performance indicates that omniphobic membranes with hierarchical morphology are promising in addressing membrane wetting and fouling issues in the DCMD processes.},

This performance derives from a network of nearly isotropic microscale unit cells with high structural connectivity and nanoscale features, whose structural members are designed to carry loads in tension or compression. Production of these microlattices, with polymers, metals, or ceramics as constituent materials, is made possible by projection microstereolithography (an additive micromanufacturing technique) combined with nanoscale coating and postprocessing.

  abstract = {Graphene aerogels (GAs), a special class of 3D graphene assemblies, are well known for their exceptional combination of high strength, lightweightness, and high porosity. However, due to microstructural randomness, the mechanical properties of GAs are also highly stochastic, an issue that has been observed but insufficiently addressed. In this work, we develop Gaussian process metamodels to not only predict important mechanical properties of GAs but also quantify their uncertainties. Using the molecular dynamics simulation technique, GAs are assembled from randomly distributed graphene flakes and spherical inclusions, and are subsequently subject to a quasi-static uniaxial tensile load to deduce mechanical properties. Results show that given the same density, mechanical properties such as the Young's modulus and the ultimate tensile strength can vary substantially. Treating density, Young's modulus, and ultimate tensile strength as functions of the inclusion size, and using the simulated GA results as training data, we build Gaussian process metamodels that can efficiently predict the properties of unseen GAs. In addition, statistically valid confidence intervals centered around the predictions are established. This metamodel approach is particularly beneficial when the data acquisition requires expensive experiments or computation, which is the case for GA simulations. The present research quantifies the uncertain mechanical properties of GAs, which may shed light on the statistical analysis of novel nanomaterials of a broad variety.},

CA can interpret the microstructure changes of materials and obtain more abundant, accurate and intuitive information of microstructure evolution than conventional methods. CA can visually represent the process of grain formation, growth, development and change to us in a graphical way, which can assist us in analysis, thinking and solving problems. In the last five years, the application of CA in materials research has been rapidly developed, and CA has begun to occupy an increasingly important position in the simulation research of metallic materials. After introducing the advantages and limitations of CA compared to other widely used simulation methods, the purpose of this paper is to review the recent application progress on the microstructure simulation of metallic materials using CA, such as solidification, recrystallization, phase transformation and carbide precipitation occurring during forming and heat treatment. Specifically, recent research advances on microstructure simulation by CA in the fields of additive manufacturing, welding, asymmetrical rolling, corrosion prevention, etc., are also elaborated in this paper. Furthermore, this paper points out the future work direction of CA simulation in the research of metallic materials, especially in the simulation of the crystal structure, the prediction of mechanical properties, CA simulation software and rule systems, etc. These are expected to attract wide attention of researchers in the field of metallic materials and promote the development of CA in materials research.},

The transient heating and cooling responses of the material were investigated for thermal energy storage. The GA had a low bulk density so that the weight percent of the GA in the composite was only about 15\%.

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of flow and transport in heterogeneous formations has long been studied, especially for uncertainty quantification and risk assessment. The high computational cost associated with running large-scale numerical simulations in a Monte Carlo sense has motivated the development of surrogate models, which aim to capture the important input-output relations of physics-based models but require only a fraction of the cost of full model runs. In this work, we formulate a conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (cDC-GAN) surrogate model to learn the dynamic functional mappings in multiphase models. The cDC-GAN belongs to a class of semisupervised learning methods that can be used to learn the data generation processes. Like the original GAN, a main strength of the cDC-GAN is that it includes a self-training scheme for improving the quality of generative modeling in a game theoretic framework, without requiring extensive statistical knowledge and assumptions on input data distributions. In particular, our cDC-GAN model is designed to learn cross-domain mappings between high-dimensional input (e.g., permeability) and output (e.g., phase saturations) pairs, with the ability to incorporate conditioning information (e.g., prediction time). As a use case, we demonstrate the performance of cDC-GAN for predicting the migration of carbon dioxide (CO2) plume in heterogeneous carbon storage reservoirs, which has both numerical and practical significance because of the safe storage requirements now mandated in many countries. Results show that cDC-GAN achieves high accuracy in predicting the spatial and temporal evolution patterns of the injected CO2 plume, as compared to the original results obtained using a compositional reservoir simulator. The performance of cDC-GAN models, trained using the same number of training samples, stays relatively robust when the level of spatial heterogeneity is increased. Our cDC-GAN is pattern based and is not limited by the underlying physics. Thus, it provides a general framework for developing surrogate models, and for conducting uncertainty analyses for a wide range of physics-based models used in both groundwater and subsurface energy exploration applications.},

  abstract = {Membrane distillation (MD) is an acknowledged promising technology for desalinating hypersaline brine, and as such can be a suitable candidate to further concentrate the seawater discharged from reverse osmosis process. Mineral scaling represents a major constraint against the application of MD for further desalination of concentrated seawater, especially when considering CaSO4 (gypsum) and NaCl. Up until now, it has been difficult to rely solely on membrane modification to mitigate CaSO4 scaling. Permeate-side aeration can lessen CaSO4 scaling, but does not permit to increase the water flux. Herein, we proposed the synergy of feed-side aeration and super slippery interface to perform concentrated seawater desalination via direct contact membrane distillation. The results of this study show that this synergistic effect could significantly increase the water flux, which was approximately 1.5 times higher in comparison to the membrane without aeration. Moreover, the synergistic effect effectively alleviates the complex scaling of concentrated seawater, achieving 90 wt\% water recovery rate. Based on the observed results, we elucidated the mechanisms governing the enhanced water flux and scaling mitigation driven by the synergistic effect. In addition, we studied the optimal working condition for this system, unveiling that low-intensity large bubbles are more suitable as they lead to a better equilibrium between the economics and functionality of the process.},

  abstract = {Many regions of the world are facing formidable freshwater scarcity. Although there is substantial scope for economizing on the consumption of water without affecting its service level, the main response to water scarcity has been to increase the supply. To a large extent, this is done by transporting water from places where it is abundant to places where it is scarce. At a smaller scale and without a lot of public and political attention, people have started to tap into the sheer limitless resource of desalinated water. This study looks at the development of desalination and its costs over time. The unit costs of desalinated water for five main processes are evaluated, followed by regressions to analyze the main influencing factors to the costs. The unit costs for all processes have fallen considerably over the years. This study suggests that a cost of {\textbackslash}1/m3 for seawater desalination and {\textbackslash}0.6/m3 for brackish water would be feasible today. The costs will continue to decline in the future as technology progresses. In addition, a literature review on the costs of water transport is conducted in order to estimate the total cost of desalination and the transport of desalinated water to selected water stress cities. Transport costs range from a few cents per cubic meter to over a dollar. A 100 m vertical lift is about as costly as a 100 km horizontal transport (\$0.05--0.06/m3). Transport makes desalinated water prohibitively expensive in highlands and continental interiors but not elsewhere.},

Excluded volume interaction between nutrient and the pore wall is only considered and implemented with reflecting boundary condition. Several effects are investigated, including the medium porosity, the scaffold microstructure and the size ratio of nutrient to pore. It is found that unlike in ordered porous media, the effective nutrient diffusivity in random media depends not only on the porosity, but also on degree of pore interconnection and overlapping, which is affected by the pore number concentration. At a given porosity, the diffusivity may increase noticeably when the pore number concentration becomes high enough. This behavior arises when the porosity is not too large (lower than 80\%).},

Since normal neural networks are data-intensive and cannot provide predictive uncertainty, we propose a Bayesian approach to convolutional neural nets. A recently introduced variational gradient descent algorithm based on Stein's method is scaled to deep convolutional networks to perform approximate Bayesian inference on millions of uncertain network parameters. This approach achieves state of the art performance in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification in comparison to other approaches in Bayesian neural networks as well as techniques that include Gaussian processes and ensemble methods even when the training data size is relatively small. To evaluate the performance of this approach, we consider standard uncertainty quantification tasks for flow in heterogeneous media using limited training data consisting of permeability realizations and the corresponding velocity and pressure fields. The performance of the surrogate model developed is very good even though there is no underlying structure shared between the input (permeability) and output (flow/pressure) fields as is often the case in the image-to-image regression models used in computer vision problems. Studies are performed with an underlying stochastic input dimensionality up to 4225 where most other uncertainty quantification methods fail. Uncertainty propagation tasks are considered and the predictive output Bayesian statistics are compared to those obtained with Monte Carlo estimates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The primary problem with membrane distillation (MD) for concentrating hypersaline wastewaters is its severe membrane scaling induced by increasing salt concentration of wastewater. Herein, we developed a superhydrophobic and welded-pore polyimide fibrous membranes (SH-welded PI FM) combined with optimizing feed/ permeate flow velocity to alleviate membrane scaling and improve membrane water flux simultaneously. The experiments reveal that the SH-welded PI FM functionalized with welding pores avoids membrane pore deformation induced by increasing flow velocity and superhydrophobicity reduces the overall adhesive interaction between crystal and membrane surface to against membrane scaling. Comparative experiments and simulation results reveal that increasing flow velocity is also beneficial for vapor transmission by partially overcoming membrane temperature and concentration polarization and alleviating membrane scaling by producing asymmetrical disturbation on membrane two surfaces. However, the progressive increase will aggravate membrane scaling because of the excessive disturbance of flow velocity to fibers enlarging membrane pores. Therefore, designing welded-pore and superhydrophobic fibrous membrane combined with optimizing flow velocity is extraordinarily effective in simultaneously improving membrane water flux and mitigating membrane scaling for concentrating hypersaline wastewaters. These findings are significant to break the trade-off of membrane water flux and scaling for MD to concentrate hypersaline wastewaters for practical application in industries.},

  abstract = {Hypersaline wastewater treatment using membrane distillation (MD) has gained significant attention due to its ability to completely reject nonvolatile substances. However, a critical limitation of current MD membranes is their inability to intercept volatile substances owing to their large membrane pores. Additionally, the strong interaction between volatile substances and MD membranes underwater tends to cause membrane wetting. To overcome these challenges, we developed a dual-layer thin film composite (TFC) Janus membrane through electrospinning and sequential interfacial polymerization of a polyamide (PA) layer and cross-linking a polyvinyl alcohol/polyacrylic acid (PP) layer. The resulting Janus membrane exhibited high flux ({$>$}27 L m--2 h--1), salt rejection of {$\sim$}100\%, phenol rejection of {$\sim$}90\%, and excellent resistance to wetting and fouling. The interlayered interface between the PA and PP layer allowed the sieve of volatile substances by limiting their dissolution--diffusion, with the increasing hydrogen bond network formation preventing their transport. In contrast, small water molecules with powerful dynamics were permeable through the TFC membrane. Both experimental and molecular dynamics simulation results elucidated the sieving mechanism. Our findings demonstrate that this type of TFC Janus membrane can serve as a novel strategy to design next-generation MD membranes against volatile and non-volatile contaminants, which can have significant implications in the treatment of complex hypersaline wastewater.},

  abstract = {Wetting induced by salt-scaling and surfactants is the Achilles heel of membrane distillation, especially for concentration of high salinity wastewater. Herein, we rationally developed a membrane with robust wetting resistance by integrating superhydrophobic-omniphobic surface and anti-deformable pores into one system. The membrane was first developed by electrospinning, which was then modified with surface roughness, and followed by coating of polydimethylsiloxane to weld the intersecting fibers and fluoroalkylsilane to lower the membrane surface energy. The product exhibits excellent wetting resistance when concentrating the high salinity NaCl solution from 20 to 38 wt\% (saturation condition), the simulated reverse osmosis concentrated water, the gypsum and the low-surface-tension high salinity wastewater. Moreover, the mechanism of membrane wetting resistance was also systematically discussed based on the experiment and computer simulation. It reveals that the superhydrophobic-omniphobic surface could stabilize the surface-bound air layer chemically, thus reducing the contact of crystals and surfactant with the membrane surface. Simultaneously, the anti-deformable pore also helps it overcome the asymmetrical hydraulic disturbance on enlarging membrane pore size, thus stabilizes the surface-bound air layer structurally. The presented development will provide a platform to understand and achieve wetting and scaling inhibition MD membrane for high salinity wastewater treatment.},

  abstract = {Energy-saving membrane separation for water purification is increasingly desired, which requires appropriate nanofiltration membranes enabling to reject undesired solutes efficiently and allows high permeation of water. Herein, we report the fabrication of three-dimensional lamellar reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hydrogel membranes with a one-step, environmentfriendly and water/vapor interfacial hydrothermal assembly process and the corresponding aerogel membranes by the freeze-drying method. The structures of the aerogel membranes can be tuned from lamellar to porously interconnected morphologies by controlling the volume of GO suspensions during the hydrothermal process. The rGO aerogel membrane was extremely flexible, which can be bent in liquid nitrogen and boiling water without any deformation, and highly stable in various solvents for at least 2 months. When used as nanofiltration membranes, the rGO aerogel membranes showed {$\sim$}100\% rejection of organic dyes and a moderate water flux (up to 53 L m-2 h-1) only under the gravity of organic dye aqueous solutions of a 30 cm height. This water self-purification property of our flexible and stable aerogel membranes without extra energy consumption provides a possibility to make cheap, portable water purification devices for utilization in emergency and home-used water purification systems in the areas with electricity unavailable or inconvenient.},

  abstract = {Cellulose membranes have eco-friendly, renewable, and cost-effective features, but they lack satisfactory cycle stability as a sustainable separator for batteries. In this study, a two-step method was employed to prepare a sandwich-like composite membrane of poly(vinylidene fluorideco-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP)/cellulose/ PVDF-HFP (PCP). The method involved first dissolving and regenerating a cellulose membrane and then electrospinning PVDF-HFP on its surface. The resulting PCP composite membrane exhibits excellent properties such as high porosity (60.71\%), good tensile strength (4.8 MPa), and thermal stability up to 160 {\textopenbullet}C. It also has exceptional electrolyte uptake properties (710.81 wt.\%), low interfacial resistance (241.39 {\textohm}), and high ionic conductivity (0.73 mS/cm) compared to commercial polypropylene (PP) separators (1121.4 {\textohm} and 0.26 mS/cm). Additionally, the rate capability (163.2 mAh/g) and cycling performance (98.11\% after 100 cycles at 0.5 C) of the PCP composite membrane are superior to those of PP separators. These results demonstrate that the PCP composite membrane has potential as a promising separator for highpowered, secure lithium-ion batteries.},

  abstract = {Essentially, the term aerogel describes a special geometric structure of matter. It is neither limited to any material nor to any synthesis procedure. Hence, the possible variety of materials and therefore the multitude of their applications are almost unbounded. In fact, the same applies for nanoparticles. These are also just defined by their geometrical properties. In the past few decades nano-sized materials have been intensively studied and possible applications appeared in nearly all areas of natural sciences. To date a large variety of metal, semiconductor, oxide, and other nanoparticles are available from colloidal synthesis. However, for many applications of these materials an assembly into macroscopic structures is needed. Here we present a comprehensive picture of the developments that enabled the fusion of the colloidal nanoparticle and the aerogel world. This became possible by the controlled destabilization of pre-formed nanoparticles, which leads to their assembly into three-dimensional macroscopic networks. This revolutionary approach makes it possible to use precisely controlled nanoparticles as building blocks for macroscopic porous structures with programmable properties.},
